    "Claim in article about why insects are attracted to light\nIn this article they are addressing the reason insects are attracted to light when they say\nHeat radiation as an attractive component is refuted by the effect of LED lighting, which supplies negligible infrared radiation yet still entraps vast numbers of insects.\nI don't see why attraction to LEDs shows they're not seeking heat. Could they for example be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat? So that even though they don't encounter heat near/on the LEDs they still \"expect\" to?",
    "Why do I only breathe out of one nostril?\nI was just sitting with my hand next to my nose and I realized that air was only coming out of the right nostril. Why is that? I would think I would use both, it seems much more efficient. Have I always only been breathing out of my right nostril?",

    "Do animals exhibit handedness (paw-ness?) preference?\nI have been observing my cat and found that when confronted with an unknown item, she will always use her front left paw to touch it.\nThis has me wondering if animals exhibit handedness like humans do? (and do I have a left handed cat?)\nOne note of importance is that with an unknown item, her approach is always identical, so possibly using the left paw means allowing a fast possible exit based on how she positions her body.\nThis question is related to Are there dextral/sinistral higher animals?. However, I question the \"paw-ness\" as a consequence of how the cat is approaching new items (to be ready to flee), whereas the other question remarks about the high number of \"right-pawed\" dogs and questions the influence of people for this preference.",
    "What is the evolutionary advantage of red-green color blindness?\nRed-green colorblindness seems to make it harder for a hunter-gatherer to see whether a fruit is ripe and thus worth picking.\nIs there a reason why selection hasn't completely removed red-green color blindness? Are there circumstances where this trait provides an evolutionary benefit?",

    "What is the longest-lasting protein in a human body?\nProtein life times are, on average, not particularly long, on a human life timescale. I was wondering, how old is the oldest protein in a human body? Just to clarify, I mean in terms of seconds/minutes/days passed from the moment that given protein was translated. I am not sure is the same thing as asking which human protein has the longest half-life, as I think there might be \"tricks\" the cell uses to elongate a given protein's half-life under specific conditions.\nI am pretty sure there are several ways in which a cell can preserve its proteins from degradation/denaturation if it wanted to but to what extent? I accept that a given protein post-translationally modified still is the same protein, even if cut, added to a complex, etc. etc.\nAnd also, as correlated questions: does the answer depend on the age of the given human (starting from birth and accepting as valid proteins translated during pregnancy or even donated by the mother)? What is the oldest protein in a baby's body and what is in a elderly's body? How does the oldest protein lifetime does in comparison with the oldest nucleic acid/cell/molecule/whatever in our body?",
    "Are humans more adapted to \"light mode\" or \"dark mode\"?\nI was discussing with a colleague about using dark-mode vs. light mode and remembered an article arguing that humans vision is more adapted to light-mode rather than dark-mode:\nI know that the trend \u201cdu jour\u201d is to have a dark mode for pretty much everything, but look around the world is not dark with a bit of light, it\u2019s actually the contrary. And as the human has evolved its vision to adapt to this reality, it\u2019s asking extra efforts on many people.\nUnfortunately, no reference is provided to support this claim, so I am wondering if this is just an opinion or there are some studies to support this.\nWikipedia seems to confirm this somewhat since we are adapting much faster to \"light mode\" transition than to dark mode one:\nThis adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds.\nAlso, some studies confirm that working using light mode is on average more efficient than using dark mode:\nlight mode won across all dimensions: irrespective of age, the positive contrast polarity was better for both visual-acuity tasks and for proofreading tasks.\nI am looking for arguments coming from evolutionary biology to confirm (or not) the assumption that human evolution favors light mode.",
    "If the brain has no pain receptors, how come you can get a headache?\nI've read many years ago in books, that the brain has no nerves on it, and if someone was touching your brain, you couldn't feel a thing.\nJust two days before now, I had a very bad migraine, due to a cold. It's become better now, but when I had it I felt my head was going to literally split in half, as the pain was literally coming from my brain.\nSo it lead me to the question: How come people can get headaches if the brain has no nerves?",

Or which group of animals are all primates most closely related to?",
    "How do trees manage to grow equally in all directions?\nI was walking down a road with these beautifully huge trees when this question occurred to me.\nLarge trees with many thick branches have to grow equally in all directions, or they would tip over. Is there some sort of mechanism to ensure this uniform growth? Or is it just a happy coincidence arising from uniform availability of sunlight on all sides? If one branch of a tree becomes too heavy due to many sub-branches, does this somehow trigger growth on the opposite side of the tree?\nI have seen that potted plants in houses tend to grow towards sunlight. My mum often turns pots around by 180 degrees to ensure that plants don't bend in any one direction. I assume that this is because sunlight increases the rate of photosynthesis, leading to rapid growth of the meristem. For trees growing in open spaces, this wouldn't be a problem. But there are many large trees that grow in the shadow of buildings without bending away from the buildings, even though this is the only direction from which they would receive any sunlight. Is there any explanation for this?",
    "What do you see when your eyes are closed?\nIf you are in pitch black and you close your eyes, you sometimes can see strange shapes of various colors. A lot of the time these shapes and colors change as you observe them. This phenomenon still occurs if you are not in complete darkness.\nI am wondering what this is that you are `seeing'? Is this phenomenon classified as seeing, as how can we be looking at something if our eyes are closed?\nIf you are not seeing these shapes and colors, then what you observe is pure darkness. What is this pure darkness that you are seeing? Since you are seeing it, is something stimulating the vision parts of your brain? Is it the back of your eyelid?",

When I eat food that has x grams of 'protein', what is this? A homogenous mix of proteins? A heterogenous one? Is it specific set of them that are general enough to be used by my body despite coming from a different organism? How can it be sure that my body can use the kind of protein in the food?\n",

Is it instinctively erotic? Or is it just a conventional form to show trust and intimicy, i.e. the association besically just comes via a social means?\nBecause the only other advantage of this mouth to mouth contact I could see is maybe for the immune system.",

    "Why do you die if you cannot breathe?\nI was wondering what the actual reason for death by suffocation is. Obviously it is related to oxygen deprivation. But what is the underlying cause of death?\nIs it due to insufficient oxygen for aerobic respiration, and the resulting lack of ATP (as anaerobic respiration forms less ATP)?\nOr is it because of the build-up of lactic acid, causing enzymes to denature?\nOr is it the lowering of the pH of the blood because of a build-up of carbon dioxide which forms carbonic acid and subsequent denaturation of enzymes?",
    "What's the mechanism for being mentally tired?\nI notice that after long tests, or long periods of critical thinking, my body and mind feel noticeably tired. Why does this happen? Are the neurons in my head not firing as quickly, or is there just a perceived lack of mental concentration?\nWhat exactly is the mechanism that makes my brain feel worn out, or at least gives me the perception of my brain being worn out?",
    "How is temperature sensed?\nCan anyone summarize the mechanism by which when an object of a given temperature is placed in contact with, say, the skin on a human fingertip, the average speed of the particles of the object is converted into nerve signals to the brain?\nIf you can answer that, how about the format of how the temperature is encoded in the nerve signals?",

    "Hot water and bacteria\nI know that it is common to say, \"use hot water when washing your hands\" or when you've got a cut, \"wash your hands with warm water,\" etc. I was wondering, why is this the case? Since bacteria grow in warm environments, you would think that it might be beneficial for bacteria. Is this just another myth or is this actually true?",
    "Why does my room suddenly look 'reddish'? My eyes seem to adapt to color\nTo get the context of this question clear, I would like you to walk through some parts of my house.\nWe'll start with one of my rooms as it appears normally - area Y\nAs evident, this part of my house has a creamish tinge to it, also the balcony door is open which further gives this room a yellow tint. Nothing special. I'll call it \"area Y\" (for yellow)*. Let's move on.\narea G\nHere we arrive in another part of my house which has greenish/blue shades acting as a sunlight blocker. This gives this entire place a greenish/blue tint as shown. (Ref. \"area G\")\nSo, now let's visit the area Y again. I am always surprised with what my eyes now see. This. {1}\nenter image description here\nYou see, the same room, same lightning, yet the room now looks much more reddish than before! That's what intrigues me, why does it happen? Why my eyes suddenly become sensitive to red color?\nI am not a biology student but I do know that our eyes have cones which specialize in color perception, and that there are different types of cone cells to perceive different types of colors (If I remember my high school biology correctly).\nSo, I somewhat get a feeling of what's happening inside my eyes (or the brain perhaps?). I suspect that as I go to area G, my eyes 'adapt' to the dominance of bluish/green light, either by decreasing pigment of blue cones or by increasing pigment of red cones, which makes my eyes more sensitive to the other end of visible light spectrum (red-yellow), causing an 'outburst' of red coloration in area 'Y'. Since pigments need time to degrade, by the time the red color pigment of my cones decreases, its activity is less than normal. It may be increased as the blue pigment's activity is less than normal and I see a reddish tinge for few moments.\nThis was a pure hypothesis from my part, but it seems correct to me. But why do my eyes even adapt to blue color? Why can't my eyes be unbiased towards colors?\n{1} Obviously I photoshopped the red tint in the image how else could I have replicated my vision? Though it's not the most accurate description of what I see it's still a very close approximation.",

    "Why can't humans drink sea water?\nIt would seem to be a huge evolutionary advantage for an animal to be able to drink sea water rather than have to rely on fresh water, and it's provably not impossible due to the existence of sea mammals that must filter the sea water somehow.\nCould someone explain to me any likely reasons that this is the case?",
    "Is monogamy a human innate behaviour?\nAs the question states, got curious and I was wondering if monogamy is an innate human behaviour or is it because of how we built society (religion, traditions, etc.)?\nLet's say we go back in time, would we see humans settling down with a single partner at a time and caring for their children as a couple for life or would they reproduce with several leaving the mothers with their children?\nThanks!",
    "Are single-celled organisms capable of learning?\nI've read that the amoeba is capable of learning. Since these protists have no nervous system, it's safe to assume that even highly simplified learning mechanisms of the Aplysia are miles off in the evolutionary distance.\nHow does this species learn? I would presume that there is a complicated chain of receptor mediated transcription regulation, but what are the specifics? What types of receptors does an amoeba have to sense its environs?",
    "Why does hair turn grey or white, and why does it happen later for some?\nThe question is pretty simple: what is happening molecularly when hair turns grey or white? I would imagine that it is due to the lack of a particular compound. I'm also interested in why some people's onset of grey hair happens much later than others.",
    "Can a human be made with ovum but without sperm?\nThis article says that scientists were successful in making a mouse using only a sperm and no egg (ovum).

However, the mouth and the nose aren't the only cavities. What about the anus and the genitals? They obviously can't \"hold breath\", so how do they stop water from entering?\nI thought the reason is gravity, but then, people would be killed when diving because your butt is facing up, against the gravity.\nAnother explanation might be that the internal pressure is higher than the external one, but I fail to recall any organ that creates the pressure..",

    "Why does UV radiation from the Sun cause skin cancer?\nWhat is the specific mechanism makes non-ionizing UVA and UVB radiation carcinogenic? Can lower energy light, like visible light, be carcinogenic because of this mechanism, or is there some kind of threshold within spectrum at which electromagnetic radiation does not induce cancer in humans?\nIonizing radiation can be mutagenic, which can cause cancer. However, this only applies to high-energy electromagnetic radiation with photon energies exceeding about 5 eV, or about 248 nm. (The FCC defines this threshold even higher at 10 eV, or about 124 nm!) These photon energies correspond to UVC, which is blocked thoroughly by the atmosphere, meaning Sunlight does not appreciably contribute to the ionizing radiation we receive on Earth. Therefore, the mechanism with which solar UV radiation induces cancer must be different from higher energy electromagnetic radiation, right?",
    "What is the difference between added sugars and natural sugars in processed foods?\nWhile buying juices, I came across two options, one with no added sugars, one with added sugars. The one with no added sugars had 11 grams of sugars, the one with added sugars had also 11 grams of sugar.\nHence my wonder, does it matter what is the source of your sugar intake, whether it is naturally occurring or artificially added?\nI generally don't worry about how sweet something is as long as it\u2019s natural, like mangoes are very sweet, but my mind tells me it\u2019s a fruit hence healthy and I am neither diabetic nor fat, so mangoes are ok for me. But still I don't eat candies or other man-made sweet stuff because my mind says it\u2019s artificial. Is my mind right or wrong?",
    "Do large animals often evolve into smaller animals?\nThere are several examples where the largest animals were killed off preferentially due to a major ecological shift:\nThe KT extinction event\nThe Holocene extinction, as well as the major megafauna humans killed off\nThe common ancestor of modern mammals is thought to be \"shrew-like\" in size, and it differentiated into most of the large animal species in the world today. I imagine that a similar statement can be made for dinosaurs. In general it seems that a major extinction event is likely to be best weathered by smaller creatures which can later, over time, increase in size to fill the niche that larger animals, and evolution dictates it will be profitable to do so.\nDoes this limit large animals to only the branches of the tree of life? Any given set of (Multicellular) species obviously share a common ancestor that is much smaller than them. Is it possible for many species to share a common ancestor that is considerably larger than any of them?",
    "Is any known plant magnetic?\nIs there a plant (not a microscopic type but one that is visible to the naked eye) that has so much iron (or magnetite), cobalt, or nickel in its body that it can attract a magnet?\nIn this case \"attract\" would mean that a person holding a small magnet next to the plant can feel a small attraction between the magnet and the plant.",

    "Why is loud music much louder after pausing and resuming it?\nIf I pause a sufficiently loud song (in headphones) for several seconds, then resume it, I perceive it as deafeningly loud, even painfully. Yet, if I first lower the volume, resume, and then gradually increase it over a span of as little as two seconds, there's no problem.\nLike turning on lights when someone's sleeping, but for ears that were awake six second ago.\nWhy does this happen?",
    "Why does sex last so long?\nI wonder why (especially human) sex lasts longer than just a few seconds?\nMy thought is that the shorter it takes a man to ejaculate, the lesser is the risk that he gets interrupted by a rival or a predator.

    "Why does mouldy food make you sick?\nBread gets mouldy pretty quickly. My parents (both of whom are nurses) throw out a loaf of bread after a spot of mould is seen (because \"if you can see one spot, it means the whole thing is covered in mould spores\") because they say you'll get sick if you eat it. The USDA also has a handy chart on it's mould page telling you when you should discard food with mould on it.\nIs it the mould itself that makes us sick or is it something that the mould is releasing?\nWhat are the mechanisms that cause us to feel sick after eating mouldy food?\nThe USDA says that there can also be bacteria along with the mould on the the food - is this what is really making us feel ill?",
    "Does taking a shower have the same effect on muscles as warming up?\nWhen playing sports, coaches and trainers are always very clear that it is necessary to warm up and stretch. But sometimes athletes sometimes want to get an extra stretch in and don't want to go through the hassle of warming up.\nWill taking a hot shower warm up muscles or does an athlete sctually have to do physical exercises like jogging in order to be ready to stretch?\nI know this sounds like a question I could go on the physical fitness SE, but I'm really hoping for an answer involving thermodynamics and I doubt I'll get that there.",
    "Are two eyes necessary for 3D vision?\nIt has always been my understanding that humans have two eyes so that we can have 3D vision: the left eye sees more of the left side of an object than the right eye and vice versa. This helps us to estimate depth among other things.\nNow when I close one eye, I still am able to perceive depth. I assume this is because my brain fills in the blanks For how long does this work? Do people eventually lose the depth perception (or at least it diminishes significantly) when they lose a single eye?\nIf so, how low does it take? If not, clearly we are capable of perceiving everything with one eye. Why do we then have two (besides redundancy and a larger field of view)? What is considering the evolution of man better in having two eyes as opposed to one or three, or four,..?",

    "Why do dog's eyes glow green on a photo?\nTaking my current profile picture as a prominent example:\nDog's eyes glowing green in camera\nThis photo has been taken with flash. As I gather, this is the same effect that makes a human's eyes glow red on photos, namely the reflection of the flash at the choroid and then passing back through the retina.\nThe retina is full of bloodvessels and the blood inside them gives the reflected light it's reddish color.\nIf it's the same effect, why is the color different?",
    "How to make a fake auditory signal?\nMy question is about making fake auditory signals. The ear collects sounds from the environment, which are transformed into a neural signal by the hair cells in the inner ear. This signal is sent through the auditory nerve to the to brain, where it is decoded into a hearing sensation.\nNow can we make fake signals and feed them into the auditory nerve to bring it to the brain? E.g., instead of the ear collecting sound, could we use an electrical instrument for collecting sound and convert this signal into a neural signal in the auditory nerve?",

I always have to wait a while before my vision returns to that functional state.\nI am interested in knowing the mechanism behind this phenomenon. What do we call it?",
    "Why Do Most Humans & Cats Have Blue/Bluish Eyes At Birth?\nI've read that the eye color at birth for most humans and for cats may not always be the the true genetic color at first. This is due to the lack of melanin in the iris. This makes sense as there is no light in the womb to stimulate the production of melanin.\nMy question(s) though is:\nWhy does the lack of said melanin produce a blue/bluish colored iris?\nWhy is it not say green, red, clear, etc?",
    "How do trees communicate in the \"Wood Wide Web\"?\nI read on The New Yorker - The Secrets of the Wood Wide Web that trees communicate with each other through electrical impulses sent through their roots. Through these impulses they can ask other trees for some nutrient if they are getting it in insufficient amount or warn the other trees about an upcoming pest attack. This phenomenon is termed as the Wood Wide Web.\nSo how do trees distinguish in different types of impulses that they receive if they don't even have a brain? And does this process show any resemblance to nervous system in animals?\nAdditional YouTube video: Trees can talk to each other, but how?",
    "How does a neuron change as you learn?\nI am currently taking a course called \"Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3\", and I have a question about how well the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm for a \"neural network\" corresponds with how an actual neuron works.\nIn the course, they model a neuron like this: AI implementation of a neuron's algorithm\nx1, x2, etc. are voltage inputs, the wij are weights. The inputs are multiplied by these weights and summed up by the neuron. The neuron then has an \"activation function\" which then takes the sum of weighted inputs and calculates an output, typically a value between 0 and 1 (or between -1 and 1). You can think of the wij as representing dendrites (a higher weight means a more dense and thus conductive dendrite), and the output of the activation function as the voltage that gets sent down an axon.\nThe AI neural network algorithm creates a kind of intelligence by modifying the weights (wij shown in the picture).\nMy first questions is: Is this a good approximation as to how neurons actually work? That is, do our neurons \"learn\" by changing the weights (dendrite density, conductivity)? Or, is there some other mechanism that is more important (e.g. do neurons learn by changing their activation or summation functions?)\nMy second question is: If neurons really do learn by changing the density of dendrites, then how fast does this happen? Is this a fast process like DNA replication? Does the neuron quickly generate (or decrease) dendrite density when it receives some kind of biochemical signal that it needs to learn now?\nI understand that much of this might not yet be known, but would like to know how well the AI algorithm corresponds with current theories on biological neural networks.",

By 1 o' clock, I was feeling quite hungry, probably because I hadn't eaten anything all day and only had a light meal for dinner. However, I didn't eat anything then and just slept. Today morning I wake up (around 9 AM) and I don't feel hungry! I could surely eat something if I wanted, but I am not feeling the acute hunger that I was feeling last night!\nMore generally, what could be the reason for the behavior that a human experiences acute hunger, but after sleeping for an extended period of time, he/she may no longer have the hunger. Since a passage of time has passed, one would expect the hunger to increase, which would have certainly happened if the person had not slept. Is it the case that sleeping somehow affects the overall hunger/glucose demands of the body?\nI suspect that it is possible that the body's food needs could be majorly affected by the circadian clock, but I wanted an explanation to contrast the situation when one is not hungry and when one is very hungry before sleep. How can the difference between both the situations be easily trumped by the circadian rhythm's effect? (if it is the explanation!)",
    "Why does the butterfly have a cocoon stage in its life cycle?\nWhy does the butterfly have a cocoon stage in its life cycle? It could have simply grown up within the egg/cocoon, and emerged as a butterfly. Instead it is first an egg, then a worm, then a chrysalis, and finally after some time a butterfly.",
    "Are there lifeforms that have more than 2 sexes?\nAre there any lifeforms on earth that have more than male and female biological sexes?\nIf so, are all three mates required for reproduction or is there something else going on?\nIf not, why not? There are species that have one sex and there are species with 2 sexes. I get some of the basics of why there are two instead of one, but would those benefits not be even greater if there were three sexes?\nNOTE: I am of course only talking about sexual reproduction. I have no intention or desire to talk about transgender or LGBT issues nor am I wanting to make any points on the issue. This is solely a question about sexes in biology and not human social constructs.\nAlso, I am a computer programmer, not a biologist. Please forgive me for not knowing any of the terminology.",
    "How is the fluoride in toothpaste absorbed?\nHow is the fluoride in toothpaste absorbed by our body? Does the tooth absorb the molecule directly, or is it absorbed by the mouth?\nThe answers to this question suggest that some materials can be absorbed by the mouth, but fluoride is absent. Additionally, many municipalities add fluoride to tap water which I should imagine is actually absorbed in the stomach by a different mechanism than that of toothpaste.\nNote that toothpaste generally comes with stern warnings not to swallow. Looking at the ingredients it seems the only thing that may be harmful is the fluoride itself. Therefore I suspect that toothpaste has a much higher fluoride concentration than tap water, which supports the notion that its fluoride is absorbed by a different mechanism than tap water.",
    "Does muscle get bigger by increase in size of individual cells or increase in number?\nSomewhere in the back of my mind, I have the claim that a muscle never increases its amount of cells but, if the muscle gets bigger, it's simply because individual cells get bigger.\nThe book Anatomy Trains on page 36 cites \"Changes in sarcomere length and physiological properties in immobilized muscle by Williams et al\" when it makes the claim :\nStretched, a muscle will attempt to recoil back to its resting length before giving up and adding more cells and sarcomeres to bridge the gap.\nIs that true? Do muscles increase the number of their cells in that way?",
    "How best to count bees entering and leaving a hive to measure hive activity?\nThis is my first question here, so I apologize for all mistakes I could have possibly made.\nI'm a high school student in East-Central Europe and I need to complete some research for a biology contest (asking for advice is accepted, so I'm not cheating). My task is to analyze the influence of certain environmental factors (temperature etc., it's not that important for my question) on the activity of bees. The method is pretty simple: once a week I record the entrance to the bee hive (I do it on four hives), play it in slow-mo (It's impossible to count them properly without doing so) and simply count the number of bees entering or leaving.\nProblem is, I don't know how long the observation should take. I play it in like X1/8, you need to play it twice (entering/leaving), so it takes a lot of time to gather one piece of information for a certain day. Till now I've been doing it for one minute - and there seems to be some kind of pattern to their activity analyzed that way. Yet, I'm not sure if it's actually eligible. I can't do the observation for hours - I still need to learn and have other duties.\nSo, what should I do? Could anyone give me some advice? Is one minute (several, like 6 times a day per hive) legitimate enough?\nThank you in advance.",
    "Why do birches have a white bark?\nSeveral species of the tree genres Betula have a white bark,especially when they are young. This is quite peculiar to trees - at least in central Europe; so I'm wondering if there is a ecological reason behind it.\nThe first idea I have is that they protection against the sun. But normally protection of nature against the sun is to make the opposite: put more pigments in the skin, so that the sun does not damage the underlying DNA. If this is the explanation, how do other tree species protect against this?",
    "Why does the ring finger not move independently?\nWhy is it that we need to move little finger in order to move ring finger with it? For example, put your palm on a table and fold your middle finger inside. You won't be able to move your ring finger unless you move your little finger along with it. Why? Paul Gilbert and Buckethead and various other guitarists are the only people that I'm aware of that use the ring finger and looks independent. Is it possible to have surgery to make the fingers independent or is it not functional to do that?",
    "How old does a baby have to be before it can retain memories?\nFor most people (my earliest memories are of perhaps when I was 2 or so) their earliest memories would be when they were over a year old.\nHow old does the average baby have to be before it can retain memories? Are there any preconditions that need to be fulfilled?",
    "Which part of the brain needs to be shut down to lose conciousness?\nWhether it is mechanical (trauma), chemical (anaesthesia) or electrical - which part of the brain is shut down to cause loss of consciousness?",
    "Is it possible for a human to wake up in a wrong way?\nThere's an old folk saying that goes like \"He got out of bed on a wrong foot\" - to indicate that the person's day is going poorly because of the way that person woke up.\nIs it is possible for a human to disrupt the awakening process, causing negative cognitive side effects for the rest of the day? If so, how long does it take to restore normal cognition?\nThere's this related question that I asked - if different parts of a human brain can be asleep independently of each other? This question is a variation on that one, and specifically deals with the process of awakening or activating brain regions in the morning.\nI'm aware of the concept of \"Sleep inertia\". However, it does not seem to be the phenomenon in question, as sleep inertia is frequently mentioned in the context of napping. (where napping over a certain time leads to sleep inertia). Additionally, sleep inertia has been described in terms of decline of motor activity, and not as cognitive side effects lasting for a whole day.\nFrom personal experience, it seems that I'm doing best if I get out of bed immediately following a natural awakening, even if it is rather early, as opposed to snoozing for another 30-40 minutes.",
    "Can you accelerate the growth of a plant by accelerating its surroundings?\nI had this weird idea of making plants grow faster when I first visited an indoor nursery which used floodlights instead of sunlight. They turned on during the day and went off during night in cycles.\nIf the time period of the cycles are decreased, it would seem to the plants that the earth just switched to fast-motion. Will this trick the plants into growing faster?\nIf not the current generation, would the later generations of plants grown like this adapt to the new rhythm ?\n(Given that the plant is provided with surplus nutrients to meet the new requirements.)\nI would love to do the experiment myself if it would actually work!",
    "What causes adenosine build up in the brain when awake?\nAdenosine is an important hormone in sleep regulation. It is postulated that when a person is awake, there is a build up of adenosine in the brain, which inhibits the neurons in the brain, and produces tiredness. (See answer for more information: What causes humans to be sleepy?)\nHowever, I am wondering what specifically causes this adenosine build up. I understand ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) is broken down to ADP in the brain to produce energy. I thought this ADP would then be used to re-generate ATP again etc, so I'm not sure how adenosine is built up in the brain over a day.\nBasically I am unsure how Adenosine itself, as opposed to ATP or ADP, is produced during the waking state?\nMy theory is that during the high demand waking state there is insufficient energy to convert ADP back to ATP, and the excess ADP is broken down to adenosine somehow.\nI would appreciate an explanation of how this build up occurs, and also an explanation of how this in turn how it induces sleepiness would be a plus.",
    "How are our senses dimmed during sleep?\nOur senses are not as sensitive during sleep compared to wake. There is an arousal threshold during sleep that only when it is overcome will it wake a person up. My question is how is this arousal threshold lowered as sleep progresses? And how it is raised again during the latter stages of sleep?",
    "Do snakes get dizzy?\nI've seen snakes get captured in sacks and I've wondered if the snake would get dizzy if the sack were twirled around. I have not done any tests (and don't plan to) because snakes scare me.",
    "Why do adult insects have 6 legs?\nApparently, there is an advantage to having 6 legs in the insect world. What is that advantage, if anything? Why would such an advantage exist for insects, but not for other, larger land animals?\nWhat do those middle legs do that the front and hind legs cannot, if anything? Are they really essential, or do they just generate more muscle power?",
    "Why is funnel web spider venom so lethal to humans and not so much for other mammals?\nAccording to the information from this article,\nPeople and other primates are exquisitely sensitive to funnel web venom but, intriguingly, other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guineapigs, dogs and cats are relatively immune and often survive 100 times the human lethal dosage.\nWhy is the funnel web spider venom so much more lethal for humans and primates than other mammals?",
    "Why is cancer not a communicable disease?\nI read another question where the author is asking about the infectivity of viruses. In the same vein, I am curious why cancer is not a communicable disease.",
    "Is sexual reproduction outside the same biological family possible? Has it ever occured successfully?\nAre there any examples of two species taxonomically classified in different biological families that have successfully hybridized and produced viable offspring? If not, is there an example of where reproduction occured with non-viable offspring?\nTo be clear, I mean regular sexual reproduction that could occur in the natural world outside a lab. Even so, I'd be curious to know if it could even occur in a lab without direct genetic manipulation.\nFor example, grolar bears which are ursid hybrids between different species in the Ursus genus are known to exist. Also ursid hybrids between bear species in different genuses have been produced in captivity (sloth bear Melursus ursinus x Malayan sun bear Ursus malayanus and sloth bear x Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus). Would an extra-familial hybridisation be possible? Would this be more likely in the plant kingdom?\nThis question is inspired by a separate question on the Gardening SE which hints at a general lack of understanding of the genetic similarity required for cross-pollination in plants. It made me wonder whether there are any exceptions to the general assumption that extra-familial hybridisation is impossible.",
    "Below which temperature human muscles don't work?\nWhen one exposes theirs body parts to cold environment (especially foot and hands), they may be numb, with temporarily blocked both muscles.\nWhat is typical body temperature below which human muscles don't work properly?\nMoreover, what is the mechanism behind it?\nEDIT:\nInterested in case when muscles almost cease to work (e.g one is not able to grasp a cup), not just in small perturbations to strength.",
    "How do neurons form new connections in brain plasticity?\nI've been reading about brain plasticity and how the brain can \"rewire\" itself.\nOne of the things that is not clear to me - how neurons can establish new connections. Does this rewiring mean that neurons can \"disconnect\" from other neurons to reuse existing dendrites? Or do neurons grow new dendrites to make these new connections, adding to existing ones?\nThank you for your input!",
    "By what mechanism can hypoglycemia induce fainting?\nHypoglycemia (Low blood sugar) is said to be among the potential causes of human-faintings. I was wondering by which mechanism this happens. Google search results are abundant; there are lists of various causes and solutions, but I couldn't find a direct answer to my question.\nIs it a controlled reduction of heart function to save energy? Is it an uncontrolled shock reaction (malfunction)? I'm looking for an answer along those lines.\nThanks.",
    "Why do cyanide and arsenic smell like almonds and garlic, respectively?\nWhy do humans smell arsenic as garlic or cyanide as almonds? Do both smells activate the same receptor? Is there any reason why our brain interprets these smells the same?",
    "If Tumors have lots of mutations in them how is it the immune system can't detect them?\nIf a cancerous tumor has a lot of mutations in them why can't the immune system detect them? If a person has cancer could this somehow alter the person's immune system so it doesn't function effectively to detect greatly mutated cells? Does the fact that a tumor is 'made' of 'mutated' non-foreign human cells help it to be undetectable?",
    "How fast do we fall asleep?\nWhen looking at the process of sleeping, most research I find point to a group of mutually inhibitory cells which form a sort of biological \"flip flop.\" There's cells that promote awakenness and cells that promote sleeping. The process we typically think of as \"falling asleep\" is getting to the point where this transition can occur, but I'm interested in the transition itself.\nHow fast is this transition? In engineering, we'll typically measure the speed of such a transition as a 10-90 measurement: the time it takes to go from a 10% signal to a 90% signal. Is there a similar measurement made in such biological systems?",
    "Are there any documented cases of extinction of a species of fungus?\nAre there any documented cases of extinction of a species of fungus? I imagine it would be hard to detect something like this.",
    "Can a neuron make a synapse onto itself?\nI was wondering if a neuron can make a synapse to itself? I suspect that it would be extremely unusual for a neuron to do this. Anyway, has anyone seen even a single instance of this?\nIs the process by which a neuron 'knows' not to make a synapse onto itself is known?",
    "Are there grass or fiber eating birds?\nMy understanding, that may be wrong, is that cellulose/fibre has little nutritional value to many animals because it's hard to break down thus making consumption inefficient. However, Ruminating mammals, other mammals such as black bears, and many insects such as grasshoppers digest grasses.\nAre there any birds with the gut flora to break down fibre? Or even some that eat grass but digest it in another way?",
    "How does the eye know whether to focus further out or nearer in order to bring a blurry object into focus?\nIf the eye sees an object, but the object is out of focus, the eye could be focusing too near or too far. How does the eye (or the brain) distinguish one situation from the other? How does it know whether to focus closer or further?\nI'm interested in the case when:\nonly one eye is open (There must be another way besides parallax clues).\nThe object is an unfamiliar size\nThe object is an unknown distance from the eye.\nIdeas so far\nDoes the eye try focusing either a little nearer or further and then if that doesn't help to make the object clearer then the eye focuses in the opposite direction?\nOr is there some light-sensitive apparatus that is always a focused a little nearer or further than the rest of the eye, and so for instance if the cells which are focused further out are giving a clearer picture than the other cells then the eye knows to focus further out?\nOr is the blurriness of a object closer than the focal point a distinguishably different sort of blurriness than an object beyond than the focal point?\nOr is there some other mechanism altogether?",
    "Why can't our eyes smoothly transition from side to side without focusing on a moving object?\nWhy are we not able to slowly and smoothly look from side to side, or up and down in a single and smooth transition, given that we are able to do this if our eyes are focused on a moving object?",

    "What types of light can't a plant photosynthesize in?\nI have a plant on my desk, and it got me to wondering: Can my plant use the light from my monitors to photosynthesize? If so, what light (apart from green light, to a degree) can't plants use to perform photosynthesis?\nI know that plants have the photosynthetic pigments to absorb many different wavelengths of light (primarily red and blue) but would there be certain types of light it can't use?\n(The specific plant by the way is Schlumbergera truncata)",
    "Which part of human eyes is getting tired?\nIt's a thing of common sense that if you read, drive or look at computer screen for too long your eyes will get tired. They burn, itch and try to close all the time.\nBut I was wondering which part(s) of them need rest so much... Blinking muscles? Lense muscles? Or the eyeball is drying out?",
    "How does yeast dissolve in sugar?\nThere's this fascinating \"kitchen experiment\". Take a \"brick\" of baker's yeast (not dry yeast), and a couple teaspoons of sugar, put them together in a cup and stir together. There's no doubt both are solids: yeast is a firm block, you must use quite a bit of force initially to crush it and even then it should remain a rather thick paste. The sugar is crystals, nothing tricky about that. And then, within a minute or so of stirring, your cup contains only liquid - not entirely fluid like water, but not much thicker than cream. Solid+Solid -> Liquid.\nWhat process leads to that? What happens with the baking yeast when it comes in contact with sugar, that it turns from solid to liquid, and releasing enough water to dissolve the sugar?"
