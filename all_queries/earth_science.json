So around 12\u00b0C difference [link].\n\nSo obviously there is some sort of temperature inertia, as temperatures seem to experience a delay in responding to changes in day length.\n\nWhat is the main reason for it? Is it effect of sea ice or snow-covered land albedo? Energy stored in oceans? Energy absorbed by melting snow and ice?", "Intuitively, it makes perfect sense to think that the coldest day of the year would be the day that gets the least sunshine, the winter solstice.

Are there similar discrepancies in other English-speaking countries or in other cultures?", "Why is the sea level in Hudson Bay decreasing so much? Hudson Bay is pretty far up north, much closer to glaciers. Would it make sense for it to recede at this level with sources of fresh water relatively close?", "Are clouds a solid, liquid, or gas?\n\nI have been looking online and they are often described ambiguously as a \"mass\". For instance, from NASA:\n\nA cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds form when water condenses in the sky. The condensation lets us see the water vapor. There are many different types of clouds. Clouds are an important part of Earth\u2019s weather and climate.\n\nSince they describe it as a vapor, that makes me think it is indeed a gas. But condensation is by definition the change of state from a gas to a liquid. So that makes it sound like it could be a liquid, or contain liquid droplets rather than \"freely moving\" molecules that typically make up a gas.\n\nBut at another web site, which doesn't seem all that authoritative, it says that clouds are a solid, liquid, and gas simultaneously!\n\nA cloud is a liquid, a solid, and a gas.\n\nThat does seem intriguing.

How is this number determined when one cannot just weight the earth using regular scales?", "My question refers to the current process of climate change. CO2 is rising, which leads to the greenhouse effect, which raises temperatures. This leads to more wildfires, which reduces number of trees, increasing CO2 and reducing CO2 capacity absorption. Ice caps start to melt, which reduces sunlight reflection (less snow), trapping more heat on atmosphere. Water rises, taking over land and trees, further enhancing the CO2 absorption capacity. Oceans acidify, lowering their CO2 absorption capacity too. Etc etc.\r\n\r\nIt seems the process of climate change is a \"vicious circle\", with a lot of feedback loops reinforcing the trends.\r\n\r\nIs this the case?
