    "Can our beliefs change without reassessment or new evidence?\n\nI think the strength of our beliefs can change, say from 90-95% as the day wore on. But do people, people with or without psychosis, start and stop believing things without reasons?\n\nSuppose when I stop and think I always know something is impossible. Does that mean, even in the throes of some irrational behaviour (I sleep with my cheating wife again), I know it is, at least without encountering new evidence to the contrary?",
    "Why can't MEG distinguish EPSPs and IPSPs?\n\nI see this fact stated in many places that discuss the basis of the MEG signal but it's never been made completely clear why MEG can't distinguish IPSPs and EPSPs. Please could someone elaborate?\n\nThanks",
    "Why do fNIRS devices commonly use two different frequencies?\n\nOne of the most common techniques used for functional neuroimaging nowadays is functional near infra-red spectroscopy (fun fact: IIRC Natalie Portman worked on a research paper involving fNIRS as the modality), which shines near infrared light into the brain from a source to a detector (both called optodes) in a \"banana\" shape.\n\nIt's not uncommon to read that most of these devices, be they continuous wave (CW) or one of the two kinds that involve fast modulation, frequency domain (FD) or time domain (TD), require two separate frequencies to be emitted. For instance, NIRx explains it as follows on their website:\n\n\"For neuro-imaging applications it is by far most common to illuminate with two discrete wavelength, which is the minimum requirement to assess relative variations of both oxygenation states of the hemoglobin molecule independently.\"\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nI haven't delved into the intricacies of it, but no reason immediately jumps out at me. For instance, in the case of CW, the relative difference in intensity is all that matters, so why do we need two frequencies?",
    "What are the biological reasons for hearing loss?\n\nI recently stumbled upon an interesting online hearing test on YouTube, and it got me thinking about the root causes of hearing loss. I'm curious about the main contributing factors behind the loss of our hearing range as we age.\n\nIs this degradation primarily linked to the loss of gray or white matter in our brains, indicating a neurological issue, or is it predominantly associated with the wear and tear of some other biological input mechanisms within our auditory system?",
    "What is the term for the inability to see past one's own current emotional state?\n\nI'm looking for a specific latin or greek word that describes something like the inability to empathize with emotions that are not in line with one's current affective state. It could probably be described as a temporary or permanent deficit in affective perspective-taking that occurs when a person feels that their current emotional state is the only possible state, and that it is permanent.\n\nFor example, when someone is experiencing negative affect for some reason and then proceeds to act as if their day, or even life, is ruined, and that this negative affective state is the new norm. Or when someone is experiencing positive affect for some reason and then naively believes that \"it will always be like this,\" perhaps getting very distraught when the positive feelings eventually go away but at the same time not being able to see this pattern from the outside or take long-term steps to prevent this type of roller coaster dynamic from continuing to manifest.\n\nI have consulted various psychology resources and literature online but have not been able to, again, find the term which accurately captures this concept. I've found the following terms, \"emotional myopia\", \"emotional reasoning\", \"anosognosia\", \"presentism\", \"presentist bias\", and \"egocentrism\", which I feel are fairly close. But, apart from \"emotional myopia\" and perhaps \"affective presentism\", I feel the concepts I have found are either too general (egocentrism, emotional reasoning) or incorrect (alexithymia, affective agnosia).\n\nThe specific term I have previously seen is a single greek or latin word and is very specific, like the term \"anosognosia\". As a caveat, it might be worth saying that the description and example of the phenomena above might be slightly, but not vastly, out of sync with the term I am looking for.",
    "Are social anxiety disorder and selective mutism classified as communication disorders?\n\nI've been trying to figure this out for a long time, but I don't understand much about classification of disorders and I feel uncertain after looking at the definitions. Based on what I've read, I think these don't qualify as communication disorders, but are instead anxiety disorders.\n\nI've looked at this: https://www.asha.org/policy/rp1993-00208/ and this https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/communication-disorders\n\nIf I look at the the second one, it first gives this:\n\nCommunication disorders affect a person\u2019s ability to detect, receive, process, and comprehend the concepts or symbols necessary for communication. It can affect hearing, language, and speech. Causes include neurological damage due to a stroke.\n\nBut then it gives this definition:\n\nCommunication disorders are a group of conditions involving problems with receiving, processing, sending, and comprehending various forms of information and communication.\n\nOn the surface, selective mutism and social anxiety disorder would seem to meet the criteria for involving \"sending\" information, even if they don't meet the other conditions.\n\nAnd it would seem to me that articulation disorders also do not meet every criteria either, but are included.\n\nAn articulation disorder is the atypical production of speech sounds characterized by substitutions, omissions, additions or distortions that may interfere with intelligibility.\n\nIf I look at the ASHA definition, I can almost understand that social anxiety disorder would be excluded.\n\nA communication disorder is an impairment in the ability to receive, send, process, and comprehend concepts or verbal, nonverbal and graphic symbol systems. A communication disorder may be evident in the processes of hearing, language, and/or speech. A communication disorder may range in severity from mild to profound. It may be developmental or acquired. Individuals may demonstrate one or any combination of communication disorders. A communication disorder may result in a primary disability or it may be secondary to other disabilities.\n\nI can sort of understand why it would be useful to separate anxiety disorders from these, but I'm not very knowledgeable in psychology, so I was hoping someone could verify what the answer is.",
    "Where exactly do Emotions and Feelings arise in the human body?\n\nTraditionally, the heart region was always associated with emotions and feelings in humans. But in one recent philosophy lecture I watched on Youtube, the orator said that the right brain is, in fact, the origin of emotions and the heart is just for pumping the blood.\n\nIn Yoga and many other traditional Eastern disciplines, the Chakra Theory is quite prevalent and the Anahata or the Heart chakra/meridian is quite strongly associated with emotions.\n\nWhat is the stance of modern medical science on this? Can the source of all emotions be explained completely in the right hemisphere of the brain through neuroscience? Or is there any scientific backing for the linkage of Heart to emotions? Or such a discovery might be possible in future?",
    "What is the mechanism that makes people more likely to act when provided with proof of non-new (and often trivial) information?\n\nIs there a name for the psychological mechanism according to which a person is more likely to act when provided with proof of information they are already convinced about? Information which is often also trivial: e.g., smoking causes cancer. In fact, some studies find that graphical warning labels in cigarette packages affect implicit smoking attitudes (especially among the new smokers). Although comparatively smaller, text labels (compared to no labels) are also shown to have a similar effect.",
    "Is it unethical for a psychiatrist to invite a patient and her husband to a social function?\n\nSuppose Emma is a patient of psychiatrist Dr. Jones, in New York State.

    "What does it mean if a neuron is \"expressing\" something?\n\nSorry for the simple question, not a neuroscientist just trying to understand a paper for school. In a study with mice, there was 2-photon calcium imaging done, and part of it read:\n\nWe used single- and multi-plane imaging approaches to record the activity of populations of excitatory neurons and two inhibitory classes, Somatostatin (Sst) and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (Vip) expressing interneurons, across multiple cortical depths and two visual areas (VSIp and VISl)\n\nFirst I thought this meant that SST & VIP were inhibitory neurons. But when I Google it says they're hormones.\n\nSo is this saying they recorded activity from inhibitory interneurons that were ... releasing? producing? ... SST & VIP ? What does \"expressing\" mean in this sense.",

As a guideline, I consider the book of Diffusion MRI by Derek Jones as being the gold standard: mathematical, physics, biological and clinical considerations.

    "What term can describe the feeling that a job just does itself?\n\nIs there a term that can describe that a job, however exhausting it might be, just does itself? Meaning, for example, that all doubt concerning how you're doing a job, whether or not you should do the job instead of something else, or any doubt of the value you're creating is just not there?\n\nAs an example, I saw an interview where an author was asked how much effort it took to write a particular book. The answer was \"No effort at all, the book wrote itself\", which is of course not literally true, because it takes reasearch, time, dedication and long hard hours in front of a PC to write a book. Still, I understand what they mean by this, when looking back to certain efforts I've made myself. But I don't know if this can be described in full by a certain term.\n\nI'm surprised how hard it was to find anything about this just googling, so any suggestions would be great!",
    "Human/social behavior when one emphasizes their own superior achievements over others'\n\nI'm looking for a name/category/definition of (personality?) disorder(s) that can be described with the following traits in one's (imaginary person) social/human behavior:\n\nthis person brings up and emphasizes his own, (according to him) superior achievements whenever another person around him mentions their own success/results/etc. (relevant fact: this person's statements about his own achievements are usually true, so there is no or little exaggeration);\nstill, this person does this in a way that likely hurts other's feelings or self-esteem (this person does this regardless of who's the other half, like friends/partner/family), maybe even permanently;\nwhen this person has to do something with the achievements of others, he also emphasizes his own role behind the success of the other half (may even claim that the other person would not have been able to achieve their results without his assistance/inspiration);\nfinally, though this may be a bit further from the previous points, this person may also inspire other people to start doing the same things that he's already started earlier (through which he may have an edge in terms of performance, quicker results, etc.) - e.g., a hobby or a sport.\nI'd be also interested in the origin of such a situation/traits (like how one would develop such a behavior, e.g. through childhood events or parental issues).\n\nMy research so far: tried to look for an answer online by summarizing the main points and got to \"Narcissistic personality disorder\" which (according to this site) is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration.\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% sure that the above traits completely match this definition since they emphasize one's superior results/role in other's success and usually are combined with mean/humiliating remarks. Also, this person rarely steers a conversation etc. in a way so that he'll have the attention/focus.",
    "Are there results on the null hypothesis of the \"surgeon operating on my son\" question?\n\nThere is a common question used to demonstrate the power of implicit assumptions about gender roles in our society.\n\nIncluding it here for reference: A man and his son had a terrible car accident and were rushed to the hospital. The man died on the way, but the son was still barely alive. When they arrived, a surgeon was called in to operate. Upon seeing the young boy, the surgeon said, \u201cI can\u2019t operate \u2013 this is my son.\u201d\n\nMost people have difficulty thinking of the possibility that the surgeon is the son's Mother.\n\nThis riddle strikes me as having elements of the priming experiments whereby subjects primed with certain words perform better/worse in word-stem completion tests, intermixed with the social expectations of our culture. Here the \"priming\" would be using the male \"father\", \"boy\", and \"son\" throughout the question but asking for a female \"mother\" as the answer.\n\nI was trying to find results on some sort of \"control group\" experiment to try and isolate the societal expectations element. Something like subjects being asked the same riddle but with a mother and daughter in a crash and the father a surgeon, or where it's the father and daughter in a car crash.\n\nThe only alternative I've seen is about \"mother and daughter in crash, father is nurse\" which is again combining the two effects.\n\nN.b. I'm expect the priming effect is probably small, I just wanted to know by how much.",
    "What is the inverse of anthropomorphism?\n\nAnthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. However, one often can observe the inverse happening as well. Namely the attribution of non-human entities\u2019 traits, emotions, or intentions to human entities. For example the biography book about Winston Churchill is called \u201cThe Last Lion\u201d or professional boxers being nicknamed \u201cPitbull\u201d, \u201cTiger\u201d,\u201dThe Hammer\u201d, etc.\n\nOr would this be just an extension of anthropomorphism in which humans attribute human traits, emotions, or intentions onto non-human entities and then relate them back to humans again? Because, in order to attribute non-human entities\u2019 traits, emotions, or intentions onto humans, one would first need to attribute human traits, emotions, or intentions onto non-human entities?",

The main purpose of the study is to look at gender as a moderator of treatment outcomes, and a secondary goal is to look at whether there are differences in mechanisms/mediators of treatment effects by gender as well. I spoke with a professor in the quant psychology department about my project and he mentioned that the strength of my project is that I have follow-up data with such a large sample (and high retention rates) with a marginalized, hard-to-reach population - so he suggested using MLM. Typically, when I've used MLM in the past, I've done it with looking at clusters or within/between individual change across multiple timepoints. But is there a way to use MLM to address my research questions - 1) to look at gender as a moderator of intervention outcomes in this large-scale RCT, and 2) to look at whether hypothesized, female-specific mediators of change are indeed more predictive of improved treatment outcomes for females relative to males?

    "Bias distrusting area of expertise while implicitly trusting other domains?\n\nI've run across descriptions of this bias before, but cannot find it right now... I checked Wikipedia's list of cognitive biases to no avail.\n\nBasically, people working in some domain and having expertise in it, naturally tend to notice the problems in that area, such as incompetence of other people working in their field, bad policies and poor management decision making, etc, resulting in a disproportionate distrust of their own field of expertise. For example, healthcare workers are more likely to be vaccine hesitant because they distrust their own industry more than most due to personal experience with incompetence, mismanagement, politics, and corruption within their field.\n\nHowever, this distrust does not carry over to other domains. So for example, watching a movie that portrays something you have domain knowledge in, you will quickly notice the inaccuracies and misrepresentation, but portrayals of domains outside your expertise will naturally be believable and perceived as accurate. Similarly, reading news stories about topics that you have expertise in, you will notice inaccuracies and bias immediately, but fail to recognize that the same level of inaccuracy and bias must exist in domains outside your area of expertise, implicitly treating such news stories as accurately reported.\n\nWhat is this bias called?",

    "Is fasting an effective method to overcome substance addictions?\n\nI recently watched a testimony of a man who reports the results of a 40-day water/juice fast (no food). The individual claims to have been addicted to drugs for 22 years, including marijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, prescription pain pills and alcohol. He went cold turkey, abstaining from both food and addictive substances during the 40-day fast. After the fast, he reports complete freedom and no relapses.\n\nThis particular case raised my interest in the potential benefits of fasting in the addiction recovery arena. After a quick search I found this site which claims that:\n\nFasting is by far the most sophisticated willpower workout available. If you get good at fasting, you can learn to control every other aspect of your life. If you get good at fasting, you can overcome any addiction, not matter how deeply imbedded. Medically, fasting has been found to rapidly dissipate the craving for nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and other drugs.\n\nIs it true that any addiction can be overcome with the skills learnt by fasting? Are there studies on the effectiveness of fasting for overcoming substance addictions or any other addiction for that matter?",

Isn't physiologica arousal, behavioral reactions and cognitive processes side effects of emotions rather than being part of emotion itself? For e.g. when you feel angry your heart rate increases.

William R. Klemm Ph.D. https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/memory-medic/201203/training-working-memory-why-and-how\n\nKlemm makes the claim IQ is not fixed. He claims IQ improves dramatically in the early school years in all children. Moreover, a recent study shows that both verbal and non-verbal IQ can change (for better or worse) in teenagers. The recent study is cited in the above psychology today web link.\n\nIs it a fact or a neuromyth to claim IQ is not fixed for adults?

Are we doomed to get slower and have poorer working memories as we get much older (50, 60s, 70s, 80s)?\n\nOr can we maintain our intelligence, working memory, and processing speeds for a longer period of time if we do physical exercise, keep physically fit, and live healthy lives?",

    "Opposite of White Bear principle?\n\nIs there any phrase/term to describe the opposite of White Bear principle (also known as ironic process principle)? I'm looking for a word to describe the process where something eludes you the more you try to think of it (or remember it). I think I may have come across a term to describe this phenomenon but I'm not sure if such a phrase/term exists.",
    "What is the term for the \"knowing what you think but can't explain it\" phenomenon?\n\nI think we all experience this phenomenon once in a while, and I am experiencing it right now. It's the feeling that whatever word one tries to say it seems to be wrong (for them) or confusing (for the listeners), and would require a period of time to think out the right word that they have already known. If severed, it can lead to frustration, but it's not really about feeling insecurity.\n\nWhat is the word for that?"
