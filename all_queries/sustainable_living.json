    "Homescale designs for plastic incinerators?\n\nI'm under the impression that it's better to burn the plastic and maybe get a bit of energy from it than disposing it somewhere only for it to deteriorate into many microplastic particles.\n\nThat said, I no longer believe in industrial scale solutions designed to deal with metric tons of waste that need to be mass transported by trucks.\n\nI'm aware that plastic can't be just thrown to a campfire for it to burn completely to carbon dioxide without leaving both solid residues or uncombusted gases. Are there attempts to build small scale (home) incinerators which would be able to burn them thoroughly?\n\nAny links to a paper or a final product is welcome.",
    "How to get rid of half a can of durable water repellent spray (similar to 3M Scotchgard)\n\n(Cross-posted, together with additional questions, to a post on the /r/Anticonsumption sub-Reddit.)\n\nI have an 8 ounce (~200 g) can of Foot Locker ultra fabric & leather protector spray. I guess this is a durable water repellent chemical concoction, similar to 3M Scotchgard. I think the can may still be half full, or more. I now know that these kinds of products often contain PFAS \"forever chemicals\", and are not very good for the environment. Therefore, I think it might not be a good idea for me to use up the rest of the contents of the can.\n\nWhat's the most sustainable way for me to get rid of what's left?\n\nA.) Should I put it out in a box at the curb labelled \"Free\", and let someone else take it? They may spray it on garments which eventually end up in landfill. Later on, landfill leachate can contaminate groundwater. (Source.)\nB.) Should I try to sell it for US$1 on a local classifieds website?\nC.) Should I offer it to the staff at a local outdoors store, who otherwise might buy their own can?\nD.) Should I take it to a hazardous waste drop-off point here in Toronto, and ask them to send it for incineration? Unfortunately, normal hazardous waste incineration (perhaps 2200 \u00b0F may not be hot enough to destroy PFAS.\nE.) Should I keep the product, and re-spray my winter coat (which is no longer water-repellent)?\nF.) Should I do something else?",
    "What is the difference between biodegradable and compostable plastic?\n\nI read this and still don't fully understand the difference. Which decomposes faster? Do they mean biodegradables don't need \"certain\" conditions so they are good to go into a bin (or a hole in your backyard)? Or do they mean biodegradable plastic leave some non-soil residue behind?\n\nPlastic that is compostable is biodegradable, but not every plastic that is biodegradable is compostable. Whereas biodegradable plastic may be engineered to biodegrade in soil or water, compostable plastic refers to biodegradation into soil conditioning material (i.e., compost) under a certain set of conditions. In order for a plastic to be labeled as commercially \u201ccompostable\u201d it must able to be broken down by biological treatment at a commercial or industrial composting facility. Composting utilizes microorganisms, heat and humidity to yield carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass that is similar in characteristic to the rest of the finished compost product. Decomposition of the plastic must occur at a rate similar to the other elements of the material being composted (within 6 months) and leave no toxic residue that would adversely impact the ability of the finished compost to support plant growth. ASTM Standards D6400 and D6868 outline the specifications that must be met in order to label a plastic as commercially \u201ccompostable\u201d. There are currently no ASTM standard test methods in place for evaluating the ability of a plastic to compost in a home environment.",

    "Temperature for hot water cylinder\n\nI live in an apartment in the UK. There's an electric \"hot water cylinder\" (storage tank) to heat water for tap usage. (Not for heating, there are electric radiators for that.)\n\nThis hot water cylinder has a thermostat where you can set a temperature from 40\u00b0C to 70\u00b0C, and whoever installed it set it to 70\u00b0C. 70\u00b0C seems wasteful to me, 40\u00b0C would be enough for my use. Presumably the higher the temperature and the more electricity it uses?\n\nHowever the manual warns that the thermostat should not be set lower than 60\u00b0C to \"prevent bacteria growth\". Is this a valid concern in practice, or is it more like some kind of abstract health & safety disclaimer? I mean, I'm not going to drink that hot water, I just use it to wash stuff.",

    "What is the most economical and convenient inner insulation for winters?\n\nThe purpose is to reduce heating costs as much as possible in winters, where the temperature rarely drops below -5 degrees Celsius (23 F) at nights and 0 degree Celsius (32 F) daytime.\n\nTo me, internal wall insulation seems to be a better solution than the external one. Because I think the air inside will heat up more quickly that way, which -seemingly- would be more comfortable than waiting for the walls to warm up.\n\nin another question, one community user (@M\u00f3\u017c) mentioned strawbale for insulation. After a quick search I saw that it can be used as building material. But it is weak against moisture and mold.\n\nSo, considering factors like:\n\nHealth (should be made from a healthy material)\nMaterial cost (should be as cheap and abundant as possible)\nRobustness (should stay intact with time and mild accidental impacts)\nMoisture resistance (should be resistant to moisture inside the house, maybe can be dealt with a proper but thin coating)\nOrganisms (should not allow organisms like mold or insects to grow inside)\nwhat do you think would be the most economical and convenient inner wall insulation solution for winters?\n\nP.S. It would be nice if you include the other important factors that come to your mind.",

    "CO2 emissions from outdoor fire pit\n\nI have an outdoor fire pit in my backyard. The fire pit is about 3 feet in diameter and is similar to ones you might find at a camp site. My family and I enjoy using it purely for recreation. I\u2019ve been trying to limit my carbon footprint, and in doing so, wondered how much a fire in the fire pit contributes to it. We usually have about 2 to 3 logs, and a handful of sticks. So what\u2019s an estimate for how many pounds of CO2 are released every hour of from an average sized camp fire? Are there other gases released other than CO2 that are harmful to the environment?",
    "Electricity need to switch all cars from fossil fuel\n\nFor purely hypothetical discussion, I was asking myself how big electrical production increase would be needed for a first-world country when switching all cars from fossil fuel to EV only. I made the calculation myself for the country I live in (Italy, though the reasoning in principle would be valid for any chosen country), but the result is somehow unconvincing to me. So I would like to share my reasoning here and read you comments about it. Please note this is a very rough estimation, so please point out lack of precision in the calculation only when really matters to the general result, keeping in mind this is a very high level calculation.\n\nIn the examples I will reference data from 2019 which are the most recent complete dataset I was able to find.\n\nThe annual consumption of fuel for transportation was 7.3 million metric tons in gasoline and 23.8 million metric tons in diesel. The energy content is 46.9 MJ/kg for gasoline and 45.8 MJ/kg for diesel. The energy content sums up to about 344 PJ and 1090 PJ respectively. Converting to Wh (for easy comparison with electric consumption data) the total is just short of 400 TWh.\n\nI found out that the efficiency of an internal combustion engine mounted on a vehicle is something around 20% - 35%, so I assumed an average value of 30% for the sake of simplicity. So the real energy that goes to motion is around 120 TWh. The efficiency of a full electric vehicle seems to me to be around 75%, so the electricity needed to charge that hypothetical EV fleet would be a little less than 160 TWh.\n\nIn the same year 2019, the electricity consumption in Italy was 320 TWh. So the conclusion of all this reasoning is that a country should roughly add 50% of its electrical production to support a full transition to electrical mobility.\n\nInstinctively this seems way too much: have I made any serious error in my assumptions or calculations? Or is this basically a correct conclusion?",

    "Determining carbon reduction vs cost of various home upgrades\n\nI've done some amount of upgrades to my house to reduce my overall carbon emissions, and reading online there are all kinds of suggestions for doing even more:\n\nReplace my natural gas water heater with electric\nPut solar panels on the roof\nBuy wind energy credits\nOther kinds of carbon offsets\nGeothermal\nDon't replace my electric oven with gas (which I had been thinking about, since I hear how great they are for cooking)\nAnd of course I only have a limited amount of money to spend on this, so I'm trying to determine which action gives me the best bang (most carbon reduced) for my buck.\n\nBut I almost immediately run into a problem. Even just looking at that first one - \"Replace my natural gas water heater with electric\" - I can easily determine what the cost would be, but figuring out the carbon impact of that is tricky. I live in Colorado which is moving towards wind power, but still has some coal plants. How much carbon is my natural gas water heater emitting now? How much carbon would an electric water heater emit (when you take into account the carbon emitted to generate the electricity)?\n\nAnother example - my house was built in the 1970s so it doesn't have a lot of the energy-saving features built in to more recent houses, and I had an energy audit done that identified a lot of small items (nothing big). For example, where the tops of my walls meet the ceiling joists there are lots of tiny air gaps. Sealing those would be quite expensive, but might be worth it depending on how much energy I would save.\n\nIs there a resource (or resources) that would help me figure out how much carbon would be reduced by each possible action? Please note that I'm not looking for common knowledge or general lists, I'm really trying to drill down and determine for my specific house, what are the exact (or approximate) impacts of each possible action? I realize that answering that question for each action will require specific information about my house and situation, I'm hoping that somewhere online there are calculators that would help me understand the impact of each action.",

    "How much additional CO2 emissions will result from recent changes to US vehicle regulations?\n\nFrom the Guardian, March 31, 2020: Trump to roll back Obama-era clean car rules in huge blow to climate fight (emphasis added):\n\nThe Trump administration is rolling back the US government\u2019s strongest attempt to combat the climate crisis, weakening rules which compel auto companies to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. [...] The changes to Obama-era regulations will allow vehicles to emit about a billion more tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide \u2013 equivalent to roughly a fifth of annual US emissions.\n\nSome are claiming that this change will directly result in the full billion tons of added emissions. But just because the requirement has changed, does not mean that automakers will automatically change the mileage or emissions controls on the vehicles they are producing. This is confirmed later in the article (emphasis added):\n\nThe Obama administration required auto companies to make vehicles 4.7% more efficient each year. The Trump administration initially wanted to freeze any progress on fuel efficiency past 2020. But its final rule, written by the EPA and the Department of Transportation, sets an improvement rate of 1.5% per year \u2013 or an industry average of 40.4 miles per gallon by 2026. That\u2019s far less than the 2.4% per year by which the industry has said it will increase standards without any regulation.\n\nIs there data or estimates on what the actual increase in emissions will be as a result of the new rule? Apparently the auto industry is capable of exceeding the current standard with no regulatory pressure, but will it now move the opposite way?",

(e.g. https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/food-drink/shopping-guide/soya-non-dairy-milk). However given that consuming almond milk helps finance removing carbon from the atmosphere, would it not be defensible to consume it? For example in California, the water shortage does not drive species into extinction not does it deprive people of necessary access to clean water. But it could mean less industrial animal husbandry and less area of green lawns. I think less water to such purposes is no problem and means we probably should step up consumption of almond milk, especially in areas where water shortage is more of a nuisance and not an ecological or social issue.",

All else being kept similar between the materials to the extent feasible, is the wood product generally the most environmentally friendly?\n\nEach material has a method of production, a supply chain and equipment and fuel and waste involved. Wood is the most renewable resource, as the wood can regrow and forests provide lots of benefits. Depending on forest management, the supply chain and overall effects of using the wood might not even be bad, aside from probably using tons of fossil fuels if it's not an artisan craft.\n\nPlastic and metal on the other hand both require more extensive processing I imagine, and both are less renewable resources. Metal is finite (though plentiful for many types) and I imagine more costly environmentally to mine and extract vs. growing, living forests. Plastic is not only using fossil fuels in production processes, but also in the very materials plastics are made up of.\n\nIn terms of environmentally friendly, there are a lot of angles to look at it. Lower impact on air quality, less net carbon in atmosphere, socio-economic aspects of production and supply chain, environmental externalities (positive and negative) from the different material options.",
    "How can ceramics be recycled?\n\nHow can ceramics be recycled? Does the answer vary greatly depending on glaze or other factors, and if so, how can those factors be determined (i.e. how can I tell if a glaze contains lead or not)?\n\nMy municipality says ceramics and pottery should either be re-used somehow (e.g. ceramic tiles donated if unneeded) but otherwise should be discarded as trash. I've read about how broken pottery, if it cannot be repurposed, could be smashed up and restored to clay which can either be absorbed by soil/compost or re-used for new pottery. I don't know much about pottery though, and I imagine that 'break down to raw materials' approach is only appropriate for certain types of pottery finishing. For example, if a ceramic was finished with a lead-containing glaze, I wouldn't want to add that to compost which would go to my vegetable garden and I probably shouldn't add that to any soil fill in any case. Also, breaking down any glazed ceramic back to dust would result in not just regular clay but also the glaze, which I imagine is a mixture not as suitable for making pottery.",

These kits include single meal portions of meats, produce, and seasonings, typically assuming that customers will only have at home such basics as oil, salt, and water.\n\nOne claimed advantage to such services is reduced food waste -- each kit contains the exact amount of all perishable ingredients needed for the recipe, meaning there's no excess produce to spoil once the meal is made.\n\nHowever, the entire thing requires boxes, ice packs, and plastic packaging -- not all of which is recyclable.\n\nFor now, let's ignore the question of home delivery vs going to stores. My question is:\n\nDo meal-kits reduce total food waste?\nDo meal-kits increase the amount of packaging waste produced per meal?\nFinally, is the (assumed) reduced food waste enough to offset the (assumed) increase in packaging?",
    "In which cities \"free\" public transportation generated positive impact, no impact or negative impact to sustainability?\n\nIn Europe there are discussions about free public transportation to reduce pollution in cities. Even when in Germany first attempts failed due to economical and political arguments, the discussion about it is not yet finished.\n\nInitially I was looking for cities that have introduced \"free public transport\" to estimate in a second step what impact it might have had on sustainability of the respective ambient (e.g. consumption of area for streets and parking, climate in cities, pollution on fruits from urban gardening, life style in general, mobility, animals in cities, total energy consumption, ability to electrify transport systems, etc.).\n\nIn the meantime I discovered lists of cities where \"free public transport\" was introduced, not knowing whether these lists are complete. Free public transport cities 1 and Free public transportation cities 2. The further link points to some Pros and Cons. But they do not cover all aspects of sustainability, focussing rather more on general political, economical or social aspects Free public transport.\n\nHope this question now fits to this community.",

I'd assume that for example videos on Youtube in 720p use less power than the same videos in 1080p. I think this might be because:\n\nmore power is used by sending network to read more data and then send it\nmore power is used by intermediate network (internet) to transfer more data\nmore power is used on my end to recieve data\nmore power is used on my end to actually render the video\nHowever, I have nothing to back up my theory.

    "How environmentally friendly is palm oil with a certified organic label?\n\nI'm trying to reduce my consumption of palm oil because palm oil production is responsible for deforestation, large forest fires and loss of biodiversity. The problem is that palm oil is present in many food and non-food products under many different names and it's sometimes difficult to find a good alternative.\n\nWhen I can't find an alternative product without palm oil, I try to find one with a Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil Standard (RSPO) label because I know it's somewhat better than non-certified products. Even if RSPO standards are low it's probably the best label there is. It's more strict than the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil Standard (ISPO) and the Malaysian Palm Oil Standard (MSPO), at least according to this comparison. Unfortunately products with a RSPO label are scarce where I live (The Netherlands / Europe), but there are quite a lot of products with certified organic palm oil.\n\nMy question is: how environmentally friendly is organic palm oil, certified according to EU regulations?

    "Can pumped water energy storage be combined with rainwater harvesting?\nA recent question on what to do with harvested rainwater got me thinking about pumped energy storage systems. Since both systems require storage of water for later use, is there a cost-effective way in which the two could be combined? Specifically in small-scale applications (farms, rural communities, campuses) where rooftops are already available for rainwater harvesting.\n\nAs background, pumped energy storage involves pumping water to an elevated storage reservoir when energy is cheap and plentiful (excess wind, low demand, unused solar, etc) then letting it run through a turbine to generate power at times of low supply.\n\nSome ideas about how this might work:\n\nRain water caught on the roofs of tall and/or elevated buildings could flow through a turbine (generating power) to shorter/lower reservoirs where it could be used for irrigation or other purposes\nOverhead water tanks could be fitted with solar panels to drive pumps bringing up rain water from lower rooftops, where it would later be flowed through a turbine to provide power\nA reservoir or tank could be built near a community or farm requiring water. Wind or solar power could pump water into the tank. When water is needed it could be flowed through a turbine\nHave any such systems been implemented? Could it be cost-effective, or would it simply over-complicate things?",

For example, agricultural runoff, among other things, causes eutrophication of water bodies and death of marine organisms. This can be viewed as a conservation and biodiversity issue.\nit reduces deforestation, because large areas of forests are being destroyed to grow crops that are eaten by livestock.\nit reduces soil erosion associated with overgrazing by cattle.\nit addresses the growing concern in increase of antibiotic-resistant strains of human pathogens, which is associated with the use of antibiotics for livestock, compromising its effectiveness for humans.\nI want to answer the question whether practices of vegetariansim or veganism, if implemented by the majority of the world population, could conceivably have a significant and positive effect on the issues outlined above or even solve them altogether.

Is there anything more we can do to reduce the chemical and electrical load of this?",
    "Non toxic insect(ant) repellent for use in the kitchen\n\nI have an ant problem in my house, specially in the kitchen, where they seem to have taken over. Just found out that they have cut through the plastic packaging of some food items and gotten inside. Is there a non-toxic pesticide or repellent I could use to drive them away? I have used turmeric powder before, and it is kinda effective, specially if you make a paste and stick it where the ants enter from. But I'd prefer not getting turmeric everywhere, and since I can't exactly find out where the ants are coming from, it wouldn't be as effective anyways.",
    "How should I collect and convert rain water into drinking water?\n\nI would like to convert my current rain gutter system into a collection and recycling process. Currently the water is just runoff and ends up in the storm sewer creating more work for my cities aging and already overburdened infrastructure.\n\nIs there a way that I can collect this water, filter it naturally, and recycle the water in a sustainable way?",
    "Forcing water circulation in solar hot water installation\n\nI'm planning an installation for heating water using solar \"exchanger\" panels (solar used to heat water directly, not through electricity). I don't want to bind the reservoir, panel and tap locations to the natural circulation cycle though (hot water traveling up etc).\n\nSo, in order for this to work, I'd have to force some very slow water circulation between the reservoir and the panels; a pump that takes very little power and provides very small but constant throughput: something with power requirements low enough to make this economically viable, maintenance-proof and preferably silent. On the other hand, the throughput can be very low (the water in the panel must be given enough time to heat up, so I guess even something like 10cc/min is satisfactory) and it will work only with clean, drinking quality water and very low pressures (just enough to have the water moving through pipes, no resistances or height pressure to overcome).\n\nDo you have any idea what pumping mechanism could I use for that?",
    "Which is more sustainable: aluminium can, plastic bottle or glass bottle?\n\nI was wondering which drink container is the most sustainable one, when looking at the big picture (complete life cycle analysis).\n\nSo far, I can see the few following points:\n\nTransport: plastic and aluminium are lighter than glass, and they can be crushed on their way to recycling, which means less transport-related use of energy.\nRaw material: I think glass is probably the most sustainable in terms of resource availability and number of recycling cycles - is that right?\nPollution: again, glass would be the best at not disrupting the environment.\nWhat about the energy needed for recycling each of those products?\nI reckon this should be assessed on a contained liquid volume base.",
    "More sustainably growing Asparagus?\n\nOne of the basic points of permacultural design and water usage is that bare soil is the single greatest source of loss of water in growing food. The principle of layering plants in space and time helps reduce the overall water consumption of a garden and also increase its productivity, as much as this goes against conventional (non-sustainable) gardening approaches. The overall goals are to prevent soil from being exposed, and ensure that plants mutually support eachother, and so forth.\n\nI have been looking into applying this with asparagus, to reduce water usage involved in growing this food, but have been unable to find recommendations for plants to plant alongside (and given the spacing between plants, this leads to a lot of exposed soil). I would like to grow asparagus with as little external water input as possible. What can I plant next to asparagus to help cut down on the water loss, weeding requirements, and fertilizer requirements? I.e. how can I grow asparagus sustainably?",
    "Is there a deodorant with minimal packaging waste?\n\nI have been trying to look around me to find ways to minimize non-organic wastage...and one of the everyday things is Deodorant.\n\nI read somewhere that solid deodorants are way much greener than spray ones...hence I switched over to solid ones. I also made sure that the brands I use are made of organic constituents (Tom's of Maine.. available at Trader Joe's etc.)\n\nIf you might have noticed.. actual deodorant cake is only about 50% of plastic container. I feel its a great wastage.\n\nIs there any alternative so that packaging waste from containers can be minimized?",
    "Which plastics should I avoid and what qualities of plastics are important to consider?\n\nI see a lot of DIY projects that use various plastics, even projects with a focus on sustainable processes and methods. Is the use of plastic contrary to the idea of sustainability entirely?\n\nAre some plastics more sustainable than others? Which plastics or what qualities of plastics should I consider when trying to be more sustainable in my life and in my \"backyard\" projects?",
    "What is the most efficient design to use when constructing a bell siphon\n\nI have seen many different designs for bell siphons. I was wondering if there was one specific type of bell siphon that is generally known to be the best design. ...the most kinks worked out of it.",
    "How to determine whether hybrid cars are really more sustainable than traditional cars?\n\nI purchased a Prius many years ago, but many of my friends have put forth claims that the batteries are very toxic and thus I may in fact be creating more harm than good in using a hybrid and that hybrid's are a less sustainable solution than non-hybrids?\n\nHow can one objectively measure the total footprint of a hybrid vehicle to determine whether the use of a hybrid over a traditional non-hybrid gasoline powered vehicle is lesser or greater? Has much research gone into the entire picture? For example, when the car reaches the end of its useful life, what happens to the batteries, can they be recycled or are they thrown away? What about the manufacture of the batteries, what negative effects come into play during manufacture? Are there other externalities that I've missed?",
    "How to utilize a boreal forest for animal husbandry?\n\nForests are the great producers of oxygen, and sustainable living is hardly imaginable with meadows and farmlands only.\n\nBut how to best utilize a forest for animal husbandry, in the way that hopefully interferes with wild nature as little as possible? I know from history, that our ancestors (in Eastern Europe) have used forests for pasturing pigs. But is the best way to use a forest to 'produce' meat? What about insects, for example?\n\nMy question is about boreal forests, such as those in Canada or Scandinavia."
