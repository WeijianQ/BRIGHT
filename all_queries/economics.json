    "In what way do developed countries steal trillions of dollars from developing countries?\n\nAccording to the Guardian, rich Western countries 'steal' large amounts of money from poor countries, much more than they give in development aid.\n\nIf we add theft through trade in services to the mix, it brings total net resource outflows to about $3tn per year. That\u2019s 24 times more than the aid budget. In other words, for every $1 of aid that developing countries receive, they lose $24 in net outflows. These outflows strip developing countries of an important source of revenue and finance for development. The GFI report finds that increasingly large net outflows have caused economic growth rates in developing countries to decline, and are directly responsible for falling living standards.\n\nI would like to know in what way the money is \u2018stolen\u2019, if this is illegal and if this is indeed \u2018directly responsible for falling living standards\u2019.",

    "Can GDP ever be negative?\n\nImagine that in an economy we only produced a toy and that cost us 10 dollars. We don\u2019t sell this toy in year 1. Then this goes under Investment as +10 and GDP is +10. But say the only thing we do in year 2 is sell this toy for a loss at 8 dollars. Then investment is now -10 but consumption is +8 so GDP in year 2 is -2.\n\nIs this a valid example of negative GDP?",
    "Have governments ever defaulted on its public domestic debt or treasury bonds?\n\nRecently, some countries have experienced hyperinflation such as Lebanon, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela.\n\nHas there ever been a time when a government defaulted on its treasure bond payments due to a country's economic state, such as hyperinflation, or for some national or international political issue? By default, I mean failing to pay local and international treasury bondholders.\n\nWhen Lebanon prevented Lebanese citizens from withdrawing their money from banks, did it also stop paying its government bonds?",
    "How to understand wages in poor countries?\n\nOften when a news story is reporting on economic conditions in poor countries, they'll talk about people earning meager wages like $10/day or even only $10/month (I think I heard that in a story about the immigration crisis a few days ago, referring to conditions in the South American country people were coming from). To an American like me, this sounds ridiculous, that's less than the price I pay for a sandwich at lunch. Homeless beggars almost certainly make more than this. It's two orders of magnitude less than the US poverty line (a bit more than $1k/month).\n\nBut surely living expenses must be significantly lower in these countries, or these people couldn't even survive long enough to be interviewed. Does it really make sense to compare earnings between such different countries? ",
    "Could Gaza have been \"one of the wealthiest states on the Mediterranean\"?\n\nAccording to this transcript, (I don't have access to the original interview), Robert Kennedy told Krystal Ball:\n\nThe international aid agencies have given Hamas, have given Gaza more than 10 times per capita what we gave to rebuild all of Europe after the Marshall Plan. 8,300 dollars per capita, every person in Gaza. We rebuilt Europe with $621 per capita in Europe, and we rebuilt it. What did they do with that money? Instead of using it to make this, you know, Gaza this beautiful country with white sand beaches. It should be a paradise...They take virtually all the money and they steal it...It\u2019s not Israel\u2019s fault that Gaza is poverty-stricken. Gaza should be one of the wealthiest states on the Mediterranean.\n\nIf Gaza truly received US$8,300 per capita in international aid over time, would that indeed have made it - barring diversion of funds for non-rebuilding purposes - one of the wealthiest states on the Mediterranean? (I realize Gaza does not have independent statehood, and I'm assuming Kennedy's intent was that if it were a state it would be from the wealthiest.)",

    "Transitivity of Preferences paper\n\nI am going through some of my old grad school notes, and in my microeconomics notes on transitive preferences, the teacher made a note of a behavioral economics result where when presented with two dates, A and B, a person might say they would strictly prefer A to B.

    "Would a GDP measure be improved by excluding foreign interest paid?\n\nThe income method of calculating GDP is as follows: GDP = wages + profits + rents + interest + depreciation + taxes + NFFI. If an economy has high external debt, for instance, because it used external financing to buy machinery and equipment, then foreign interest payments will be high. In that case, wouldn't GDP (per capita) be a poor measure of economic well-being since a significant portion of the generated income is leaving the home economy?\n\nWouldn't excluding foreign interest payments in calculating GDP/ income give us a better measure since this represents what income is available to the home economy?",

    "US population growth: \"natural increase\" vs \"fertility rate\"\n\nBased on the 2017 US Census population projections through 2060, specifically table 1 (Projected population size and births, deaths, and migration), the \"natural increase,\" which is US births - US deaths, was positive in 2017 at over 1 million more births than deaths, and was projected to remain positive through 2060, reaching a minimum of 400,000 in 2050 before beginning to increase again.\n\nOn the other hand, the fertility rate per woman for the US was 1.8 in 2017, according to the World Bank.

    "Specific term for disincentivized \"doing something first\"\n\nOf course we can use \"moral hazard\" but we can use \"moral hazard\" for many things.

Importantly, the groups that copy reap similar rewards to the first group.

    "Why did the pay of CEOs decrease around the year 2000?\n\nAccording to the book I'm reading (*), the pay of CEOs tends to increase because the divorce between ownership and control allows for abusive compensation practices by the CEOs. Indeed, in the graph below we can see a near exponential rise in CEO compensation (measured as the ratio between the wage of the CEO and that of the average worker) since the 70s. I've found many sources discussing this topic, but none on the decreasing spikes in the years 1994-95 and the early 2000s. Why did this happen?",
    "Is there a name for relative diminishing returns, or relative increasing opportunity cost?\n\nConsider the following hypothetical situation:\n\nYou are producing something where the total amount produced, \ud835\udc34\n, is equal to the product of two factors, \ud835\udc4b\n and \ud835\udc4c\n. Hence \ud835\udc34=\ud835\udc4b\u2217\ud835\udc4c\n.\n\n\ud835\udc4b\n and \ud835\udc4c\n both cost $1 to increase by 1.\n\nIn this situation, \ud835\udc4b\n is not said to have diminishing returns, because holding other factors constant, \ud835\udc4b\n has linear returns. Increasing \ud835\udc4b\n by 10% will increase output by 10%, and increasing \ud835\udc4b\n by 100% will increase output by 100%.\n\n\ud835\udc4b\n is also not said to have increasing opportunity cost, because the opportunity cost of increasing \ud835\udc4b\n by 1 is equal to increasing \ud835\udc4c\n by 1, regardless of how many \ud835\udc4b\n or \ud835\udc4c\n you have.\n\nBy symmetry, the same arguments are true for \ud835\udc4c\n.\n\nHowever, if \ud835\udc4b=20\n and \ud835\udc4c=10\n (and \ud835\udc34=200\n), then by reducing \ud835\udc4b\n to increase \ud835\udc4c\n, for the same cost, you can increase output by having \ud835\udc4b=15\n and \ud835\udc4c=15\n, so \ud835\udc34=225\n. Also, by spending $1 on \ud835\udc4b\n, you would increase output by 5%, while by spending $1 on \ud835\udc4c\n, you would increase output by 10%.\n\nIn general, increasing one factor will increase the returns of the other factor, and by extension, diminish the relative value of that factor (or increase the opportunity cost in terms of the output, but not in terms of dollars or the alternative purchase).\n\nThis situation is very common in video games, and because investing too heavily into either \ud835\udc4b\n or \ud835\udc4c\n would be inefficient, people will often say that both \ud835\udc4b\n and \ud835\udc4c\n have diminishing returns. However, I've found this to be very misleading, because it implies that \ud835\udc34\n increases by less, marginally, the more \ud835\udc4b\n and \ud835\udc4c\n you have, which isn't the case. I'm also not sure if it would be accurate to say \ud835\udc4b\n and \ud835\udc4c\n have increasing opportunity cost, because the cost of both always stay the same.\n\nIs there a name for this kind of factor, and if not, how would you describe it succinctly to get across the idea that having too much of one factor is less optimal than having a balanced amount of both?",

    "Effects of retirement and unemployment on PPF\n\nWhich of the following will not shift a country's production possibility frontier (PPF) ?

If a country can produce 100 cars and 50 tons of wheat, then if the people retire later, I do not see why the PPF could shift.\n\nIn the other hand, a fall in unemployment can imply more workers in development sectors of new technologies so it will shift it, we can produce more.\n\nThe correct answer was apparently fall in unemployment. This is very strange to me, according to me justification. I believe that if we make the assumptions that workers can only be employed in PPF sectors, then yes, a fall in unemployment will not shift the PPF. But that means that there are no people working in labs, in science, in developing new technologies etc. There are only people producing wheat and cars... Also, the question is not indicating by how much is the increase of age, so we can be very annoying, saying if I increase the age of retirement by 1 year or 1 day, it surely won't shift the PPF...\n\nAlso, mathematically speaking if fall in unemployment does not shift the PPF, then a rise in unemployment does not shift the PPF neither.

    "At what point would negative accounting equity for a central bank have macroprudential implications?\n\nThe yardstick for central bank \"health\" and/or \"credibility\" can be nebulous at times.

But by the same token, central banks are now becoming bigger buyers of certain securities. In the case of Japan, the BOJ has over 50% of some maturities. The point being that when a central bank is expected to play a meaningful role when crises emerge, then it's \"liabilities\" will also be incalculable.\n\nFor commercial banks, equity serves as a quasi-clawback provision as it allows creditors to get repaid should the bank encounter extreme solvency issues.

    "Would the more robust global economy resulting from the abolition of trade be worth any costs? What would happen to the economy?\n\nHow can a giant volcanic eruption devastate the world? Aside from the immediate fatalities, the eruption can devastate the world\u2019s economy and climate cannot be understated. A good comparison would be the last recorded magnitude 7 eruption in Tambora. While the death toll was severe, it impacted the entire world. The eruption launched huge amounts of volcanic ash, water and sulphuric acid into the atmosphere, obscuring the Sun and repelling some solar radiation. The Tambora eruption\u2019s volcanic winter hit hard in 1816, which has become known as the Year Without a Summer. Temperatures dropped worldwide and climate and weather changes were felt everywhere. But Europe and North America were arguably the most severely hit, with lakes and rivers being frozen over in July and August. Crop damage was rampant, harvests ruined and food shortages widespread. Food prices skyrocketed and violent riots erupted. Malnourishment soon became a severe issue, facilitating disease epidemics that killed tens of thousands. Could it get worse? The world is already experiencing severe food shortages and rising prices, though these were largely caused by inflation and the Russo-Ukraine War. However, incidents like this, the COVID-19 pandemic and the blocking of the Suez Canal serve to underscore just how fragile the global supply chain is.\n\nGiven these risks, would it be better for the economy to abolish trade completely and develop a principle of self-sufficiency, where a state will attempt to find any way to make and obtain its resources and products completely by itself if it is even remotely possible to do so? Would the increased robustness of an autarkic economy outweigh any economic costs (many of these could be alleviated by gradually making the switch) such as increased expenditure on finding ways to obtain certain resources without trade?

We see that prior wages in IN are equal to wages in OH for T = \u2212\u221e,...,\u22123,\u22122,\u22121\n. However, we see that prior wages are \ud835\udf16>0\n higher in OH over the period \ud835\udc47=\u22125\u2212\ud835\udc58,\u22125\n, with \ud835\udc58\n some small-ish natural number. Here, parallel trends does not hold, but we might still expect to be able to observe the impacts of a change in tax policy.\n\nIs there a way to still properly estimate a Differences in Difference estimator under these situations? I imagine that we should see the same point estimate for treatment at time \ud835\udc47=0\n, with a penalty term being added to the standard errors of the point estimate which is a function of \ud835\udf16\n. That said, I have been unable to find any papers which cover this issue.\n\nRelated papers include: https://jonathandroth.github.io/assets/files/HonestParallelTrends_Main.pdf\n\nHowever, as far as I can tell, that paper deals with differences in trends after treatment, while I am interested in differences in trends prior to treatment.",
    "What are the consequences of a single global currency on trade?\n\nSorry for the general nature of the question but I find it difficult to wrap my head around the idea of a global currency.\n\nLet's say there existed a single global currency which was not controlled by a centralized entity. All countries use this currency as their national currency. Let's also assume there exists some mechanism by which countries can come to a consensus about changes to the global monetary system (money supply, interest rates, etc).\n\nMy question is, is there a way to achieve price stability in such a system? Would trade get in the way of the ability to achieve price stability, since the price of goods/services is different in each country?\n\nExcuse me if I am getting major concepts wrong. I am new to economics but extremely interested in this problem.",

    "New financing instruments as covert leverage?\n\nBack when the Federal Reserve intervened in the commercial paper market in the 1970s, corporates essentially woke up the next morning and found they had two back-stopped modes of financing: their own paper and bank loans. It seems like it would be possible for the (large) companies to issue their own paper and then tap into their bank credit lines if they had trouble rolling the paper over for whatever reason. In effect, banks then, would be on the hook in that scenario. We could call this a covert liability, as it technically would not appear on the bank's balance sheet.\n\nQuestion\nWould this be a fair characterization of how money market instruments interact with each other and on aggregate change the supply of money, seemingly circumventing the powers of the Federal Reserve (in terms of capital adequacy and all that alphabet soup around tier 1 capital)? If so, has anything changed since then?",
    "What is the name for the term/principle that trade causes a net increase in utility\n\nPretend that I grow and sell apples and that you are a hungry person. At that point of time, having an apple is more useful to you than having money. Because you are hungry and can\u2019t eat money. However, to me having money would be more useful to me because I have more apples than I could ever use myself. After you buy the apple from me we are both better off.\n\nThis seems to be to be a basic economic principle but because I can describe the idea but don't have its name I don't know what to search for to read up more about that idea.",
    "What were the benefits of creating ON RRP (versus expanding the availability of IOR)?\n\nI'm not understanding why the Fed decided to introduce their Overnight Reverse Repo Facility (ON RRP).\n\nFrom the St. Louis Fed, it helps to provide a floor for the Federal Funds Rate (FFR), a market-determined rate at which banks lend to one another.\n\nNot every financial institution that operates in the federal funds market has access to interest on reserves. So, the FFR could fall below the setting of the Interest of Reserves (IOR) rate.\n\nTo aid in the control of the level of the FFR, the Fed introduced the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility to a broad set of financial institutions.\n\nAnother option seems to be simple, giving more institutions accounts at fed banks, allowing them to also get IOR. Or even allow them accounts, but do not give them the same interest as depository institutions.\n\nFurther, ON RRP is no longer cash, so there must be use for the Fed to be ridding themselves of Treasuries overnight, but it's not clear why.",
    "How are stock prices determined in the following cases?\n\nI looked at this question already. I know there is an order book with bid and ask and that the price is updated when a match occurs. But I have two questions:\n\nWhat happens when the bid is higher than the ask? For example someone is ready to pay $101 per share for 100 shares and someone wants to sell 100 shares at $100. What will be the new price?\n\nWhat if there are multiple matches at an instance? Let's say we have someone wanting to buy 100 shares at $100 and someone wanting to sell 100 shares at $100. We also have someone wanting to buy 500 shares at $110 and someone wanting to sell 500 shares $110. What is the new price?",
    "What's wrong with this argument that the fed's OMOs don't change the money supply\n\nIs there anything facially stupid about the following argument that fed open market operations don't affect the money supply? And if not, are there any professional economists who have made this argument?\n\nWhen the fed buys or sells treasury bonds they are not changing the broader stock of highly liquid assets that include treasury bonds (is that m3?), since they are just exchanging one of the components (cash) for another (govt bonds). Since there are no reserve requirements for commercial banks -- only capital requirements -- this doesn't actually affect the rate of credit creation since a bank that exchanges a dollar of central bank reserves for a dollar of us treasury debt is just as well capitalized as it was before.",
    "How can the exchange rate be virtually constant with major inflation rate difference and a widening trade deficit?\n\nI have recently had a discussion with a colleague about what seems to be a rather strange macroeconomic aspect in Romania (which has RON currency):\n\nEUR-RON exchange rate has been virtually a flat line in the past year\nRomania's Balance of Trade widened to an almost record value\nEUR annual inflation rate is about 9% now\nRON annual inflation rate is almost double now\nAll these factors seem to put pressure on RON to lose value when compared to EUR and yet it is rather constant for quite a while.\n\nThe only factor I know is very different between EUR and RON is the base interest rate and I guess is acting in the opposite direction:\n\nEURIBOR is barely positive\nROBOR 3M is more than 8%\nWhat could maintain such a robust exchange rate for the EUR-RON pair? Namely, how can RON not lose value in this context for a rather long time (many months)? I am interested in a mostly qualitative answer.",

    "Does low nominal interest rate encourage lending?\n\nIn expansionary monetary policy, it's written:\n\nThe Fed purchases more government bonds to drive down interest rates and increase the money supply.\n\nNow, low interest rate can infer two things:\n\nPeople find it easier to take loans and invest. So, investment goes up.\n\nBut, at the same time, low interest rate may mean that lenders may not be very keen on giving out loans. For example, people would find no use in keeping cash into bank accounts which provide low interest rates. This may drive down lending, and hence investment.\n\nIs point (2) correct? If so, why is low n.i.r. considered good for economic growth?\n\nThanks",

Then the two sides each secretly write down how many points they're willing to bid for each of those things. Then both sides reveal what they wrote down, and the highest bidder for each thing gets the thing they bid on.

During the process of creating this, I have also created some custom data that I realized I could sell to weather data provider companies. They will not compete with my web app, so this would be great extra income.\n\nThis is where the problem is. A company has expressed interest in licensing this data from me on a monthly basis. Besides the cost of my servers ($1,000 to $2,000 a month?) I do not know how much to offer this data for. The last thing I want to ask them is \"how much would you like to pay?\".\n\nTo them, this would be helpful as they can re-sell the data to their own emergency management customers. I feel like it would be worth about $1,000 to $3,000 a month on top of server costs. It's not super revolutionary data, but it's going to be useful for them and they might be expecting to pay $8,000 a month (random guess).

Are there any reasons for that, f.ex. due to Germany leaving the Bretton Woods System in 1973? What are some reasonable explanations?",
    "Irreversibility in the Creation of Value\n\nIn his book The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker says that\n\nA pattern of matter, energy, and/or information has economic value if the following three conditions are jointly met:\n\nIrreversibility: All value-creating economic transformations and transactions are thermodynamically irreversible.\nEntropy: All value-creating economic transformations and transactions reduce entropy locally within the economic system, while increasing entropy globally.\nFitness: All value-creating economic transformations and transactions produce artifacts and/or actions that are fit for human purposes.\nThese conditions seems pretty logical for me, particularly the \"fitness\" thing. However, I wonder about the \"irreversibility\" part: it sounds logical to state that, say, once a tree is transformed into a chair it cannot be turned into a tree again; so, making a chair is clearly irreversible. In the same vein, if a barber cut the hair of someone, he or she can not \"uncut\" it - irreversibility, of course.\n\nBut what if I was a doorman? My job would be to open a door for the others the whole day, which is a service that many people value to some extent, i.e., I would be creating some value in the economic sense of the term, right? But I can close the door as easily as I can open it, so it is something clearly reversible. Thus, it seems obvious I may do something \"reversible\" that is valued by someone - should I conclude Beinhocker is wrong or - I as suspect - I am missing something?",

    "How could you partition Household Food Expenditures into Producing Industries?\n\nFrom the 2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey, the average household annual food expenditure was $8,169 for that year.

That is, if buying bread is related to a farm purchasing harvesting equipment, maybe some of those dollars should be allocated towards both farms and industrial machinery.\n\nHere are a few immediately relevant BEA industry summaries:\n\n111CA: Farms\n113FF: Forestry, Fishing & Related activity (the fish is sold to markets?)\n311FT: Food and Beverage & tobacco\n445: Food and Beverage Stores\n722: Food services and Drinking places\nIn my studies of the Leontief Input/Output model, one thought is just to pile all $8,169 into 311FT and let the \"recipe\" tell me how much that 111CA contributed, but that feels contradictory since it predicts 0 final demand at the household level for 111CA, when clearly that industry has a large GDP number.\n\nSo what is the best way to \"attribute\" the household expenditures on food into those industries?",
    "Why is having a big corporation keep its money in foreign countries a bad thing in the public's eye?\n\nI have been trying to dig deeper into corporate tax evasion, and how it works, to really determine if they're doing something bad or what. I don't know much about economics or politics, but I hear people all the time saying \"tax the corporations! they are finding loopholes not to pay taxes and that is bad!\" I don't understand why, and want to know what is going on and why people think it's bad.\n\nFor example, I read this:\n\nThe law installed a \"territorial\" system in which global corporations aren't taxed on foreign profit. The TCJA encourages them to reinvest it in the U.S. This benefits pharmaceutical and high-tech companies the most.3\n\nMultinationals were taxed on foreign income earned under the prior \"worldwide\" system. They didn't pay tax until they brought the profits home. As a result, many corporations reinvested profits earned overseas into those markets. It was cheaper for them to borrow at low interest rates in the U.S. than to bring earnings home. As a result, corporations became debt-heavy in the U.S. and cash-rich in overseas operations.\n\nBasically, if you go to the Cayman Islands and pay a low tax rate, somehow money you make there (I don't know how you \"make money\" in these foreign places if your real business is elsewhere), and you don't \"bring it home\" to the U.S.. Instead you leave it there and reinvest (into what, I don't know). This in theory means you can make money (somehow) and pay lower taxes on it (in the tax haven).\n\nCan you explain how this works and why it is considered bad by some people on the left specifically? Why would they borrow money in the US and have cash in another country? How much money is a large corporation even borrowing? Basically, how does this work, what is an example?",
    "Filling gap in data with correlated series\n\nI have two time series, of different length.

    "Is there any example for \"pluralistic ignorance\" in economics?\n\nToday I read a paper recently written by Bursztyn, 2021 saying that\n\nThe origin, persistence, and rigidity of misperceptions about others can in principle be explained by different conceptual frameworks, such as stereotyping (e.g., Bordalo et al. 2016), motivated reasoning (e.g., Benabou and Tirole 2016), and pluralistic ignorance (e.g., Kuran 1997; Bursztyn, Egorov and Fiorin 2020; Bursztyn, Gonz\u00b4alez and Yanagizawa-Drott 2020)\n\nFrom what I understand, pluralistic ignorance is\n\nthe situation in which almost all members of a group privately reject group norms, yet believe that virtually all other group members accept them\n\nHowever, I still not yet got the idea of this behaviour, could you give me an example in economic or finance to understand it more?\n\nUpdate: Adding a great explaination of \"pluralistic ignorance\" as suggested by @Lason\n\nThe term \u201cpluralistic ignorance\u201d was coined to describe the situation in which almost all members of a group privately reject group norms, yet believe that virtually all other group members accept them (Katz and Allport, 1931). Under such situations, individuals predict that they would lose social standing if they behaved as they wished. Behaving against the group norm could result in negative reactions from other ingroup members. Therefore, people are likely to follow perceived group norms to maintain positive impressions in their groups, even when they do not support the norms (Miller and McFarland, 1987; Miller and Prentice, 1994; Prentice and Miller, 1996; Geiger and Swim, 2016). In line with this idea, in situations of pluralistic ignorance, some people even actively enforce the perceived norms (i.e., publicly criticizing a \u201cmisfit\u201d into accepting the norm), although they privately disapprove of the norms (Willer et al., 2009). Consequently, public behaviors of groups as a whole do not coincide with the majority of group members' private preferences under circumstances of pluralistic ignorance. Thus, the situation of pluralistic ignorance is well represented in the following sentence: \u201cNo one believes, but everyone believes that everyone else believes\u201d (Krech and Crutchfield, 1948).",

    "Large National Debt by borrowing money from foreign sources\n\nI have a question about the greater severity of large national debt caused by borrowing from foreign sources.\n\nI am reading a book about elementary Economics and am currently on a chapter discussing the strengths and weaknesses of demand-side policies.\n\nThe book (A-level Economics, Anderton, 2015, pp. 204) states the following:\n\nKeynesian economics states that so long as a government can print money to finance its deficit without fueling inflation or borrow money from the financial markets, then the National Debt is not a problem for the short term. Nearly all economists, however, would argue that, in the long term, large National Debts can be a problem particularly if they are financed mainly by borrowing money from foreigners.\n\nHowever, I am struggling to understand how they can be worse than borrowing from domestic debt markets (if I have stated the correct market i.e. from a domestic lender).\n\nMy understanding was that if the debt was financed through printing more money, and had to pay off the loans to a foreign lender, it would find it harder to reduce the supply of money via reversing quantitative easing i.e. selling bonds back into the bond market, so impending inflation in the long term would occur.\n\nHowever, the book does not qualify its statement regading large National Debt as above so I am not sure what the justification is for Anderton's statement above.\n\nWhy would large National Debts financed by foreign lenders be a greater problem than domestic lenders if the problem was to be solved by printing more money?",

    "What are some negative/positive aspects from globalization in regard to developed countries?\n\nI have read many articles on how globalization is helping developing countries, as more and more companies from developed countries have been moving their production oversees. However, as hard as I tried, I couldn't find a lot of articles talking about the opposite site of the story - How globalization affects developed countries.\n\nMost of the articles I found were focused on the fact that moving production oversees will increase the unemployment and decrease the GDP. However, are there any other aspects (positive or negative)? Would love to learn more about this topic and if you have a good article that dives into this I would be really grateful if you can provide me with a link to it.",

I am wondering if there is any mathematical or intuitive way to explain this phenomenon."
