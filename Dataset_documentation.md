# BRIGHT
BRIGHT is the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. 
The queries are collected from diverse domains (StackExchange, LeetCode, and math competitions), all sourced from realistic human data.
Experiments show that existing retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT, where the highest score is only 21 measured by nDCG@10.
BRIGHT provides a good testbed for future retrieval research in more realistic and challenging settings.

```
How good is it to reuse water from plant pots?

I'm living in an apartment, and after I water my plants the water goes to plates below the pots. The pots are in a metallic structure above the plates, so I can take the plates to reuse the water (throwing it at the plants again).

This reuse seems beneficial, because I think I can get rid of mosquitoes that would reproduce in the stagnated water. And also some nutrients of the soil (as well as earthworms) can return to the vase.

Is there some negative points in doing that?

EDIT: I think I must add that I'm at 3 degrees of latitude, in a hot and humid tropical rainforest, where the precipitation used to be around 1700 mm. So I use lots of water everyday, more than once a day sometimes, so the reused water is a small fraction of the water used.

i think you mean "pots" if they have dirt in them. "vases" hold water and cur flowers. â€“

Yes, @KateGregory, you're absolutely right. That's because in Portuguese we call them "vasos" :) â€“

In my experience plants suffer in the long term from accumulation of salts in the soil, so fresh water would be better than reusing the water. Even better would be to get hold of fresh rain water (tricky in an apartment though, unless perhaps you have a balcony that gets rained on) for watering them, as that won't contain the salts that tap water does.

- **Source:** LeetCode is a popular coding platform for programmers to practice. One example is:
```
5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic
 
substring
 in s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.
```
- **Source:** AoPS contains math competition questions. [One example]() is:
```
Problem 1
What is the ones digit of 222,22 -222,222, -2,222,-222222 \
A. 0
B. 2
C. 4
D. 6
E. 8      
        

Solution 1
We can rewrite the expression as\[222,222-(22,222+2,222+222+22+2).\]
We note that the units digit of the addition is $0$ because all the units digits of the five numbers are $2$ and $5*2=10$, which has a units digit of $0$.
Now, we have something with a units digit of $0$ subtracted from $222,222$. The units digit of this expression is obviously $2$, and we get $\boxed{B}$ as our answer.

**(Task Type)**

**Task description & instructions:** 
In this section, we describe the instructions for annotators to collect data in BRIGHT.

StackExchange
1. Browse posts from the newest to the oldest.
2. Discard posts without an answer accepted by the user or obtains more than 5 votes

3. Discard answers of posts without URL links.
4. For each link in the answer, write down the answers to: (1). why are the document and the
post relevant; (2). what is the reasoning required to understand the relevance between the
post and the document. If there answers are not possible, discard the link.
5. Use LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate post key words, or use the post title to
search for web pages with large keyword or semantic overlap in Google. Search for at most
5 negative web pages per query.
6. Split every web page into small passages either by two newline symbols, "#" in markdonw
files or fixed-length tokens

TheoremQA

In TheoremQA, the main task for the annotator is to check if the GPT-4 rewritten questions are valid.
The specific instructions are as follows:
1. Read the rewritten question and determine if it is solvable.
2. If it is solvable, read the original question and solution, and determine if the rewritten
question is consistent with the original question. That is, the same reasoning steps and the
final answer should hold.
3. If it is also consistent, mark the question as valid, and make any minor edits to the problem
statement (e.g., to improve grammar or fluency) as you see fit.
4. If it is not solvable or not consistent, read the original question and solution, and correct the
rewritten question if possible. If not, then discard the problem.

AoPS
In AoPS, annotators are tasked to find questions from the AoPS Wiki and record the problems:
1. Browse through the AoPS Wiki and find topic/category pages (example 1, example 2).
2. Look through each page and find pages specific theorems or techniques that can be used
to solve problems. The page should link to at least two competition problems (example 1,
example 2).
3. Record the links of both the theorem/technique as well as the problem pages.
The annotators are assigned a category to look for theorems in to avoid overlaps, and the categories
are {algebra, geometry, calculus, probability, number theory, other}. After all links are
collected, we use a web scraper to collect the problem statement and solutions, and we manually
check the quality of the scraped data.

LeetCode
In LeetCode, annotators determine whether a question is grounded in real-world concepts. We give a
similar instruction to the annotator as to GPT-4:
1. Read the problem statement carefully.
2. Categorize the question into one of three categories:
â€¢ 0: The question is not grounded in any real-world concepts. The description only uses
coding-specific terms, such as "linked list", "binary search", "palindrome", "sorting",
etc..
â€¢ 1: The question is not grounded in any real-world concepts or real-world concepts that
are commonly used in the context of coding, such as needle in a haystack, strings/words,
or a spiral matrix.

â€¢ 2: The question is grounded in real-world concepts that are not commonly used in the
context of coding, such as building height, planting trees, or games. It may still uses
some code-specific terms to specify the data structure involved.

**Methods used:** Basically we follow links/tags to find documents

**Inter-rater adjudication policy:** Reviewers annotate where the pairing of queries and documents are not convincing.

**Golden questions:** N/A
