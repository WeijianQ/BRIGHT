# Query `52`

## Original Question

*Tetens coefficients appear in a few meteorological/climatological models that I've been looking at,for example APSIM:

svp_A = 6.106
svp_B = 17.27
svp_C = 237.3
These same values appear in at least two other models, but I can't find any documentation about what they represent, or where they come from. What are these numbers?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here involves understanding the significance and origin of the Tetens coefficients (svp_A = 6.106, svp_B = 17.27, svp_C = 237.3) as they appear in meteorological and climatological models, such as the APSIM (Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator). These coefficients are used in formulas to calculate various atmospheric parameters, but without context or documentation, their meaning and derivation might seem obscure.

To address this problem, let's break down the information and related concepts:

### 1. Understanding the Role of Tetens Coefficients

The Tetens coefficients are used in equations to estimate the saturation vapor pressure (SVP) of water in the air. The saturation vapor pressure is a critical component in understanding and predicting weather patterns, as it relates to humidity, dew point, and the potential for precipitation. The ability to accurately calculate SVP is essential for models that simulate agricultural productivity, weather forecasting, and climate change scenarios.

### 2. The Tetens Formula

The formula that utilizes these coefficients is often derived from or related to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which describes how the pressure of a gas in equilibrium with its solid or liquid phase changes with temperature. However, the exact formula involving these specific Tetens coefficients is commonly referred to as the Tetens equation, a simplified version of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. It is specifically tailored for meteorological purposes and is given by:

\[ e_s(T) = svp\_A \times \exp\left(\frac{svp\_B \times T}{T + svp\_C}\right) \]

where:
- \( e_s(T) \) is the saturation vapor pressure at temperature \( T \) (in degrees Celsius),
- \( svp\_A = 6.106 \) is a constant representing the saturation vapor pressure of water at 0°C in millibars,
- \( svp\_B = 17.27 \) and \( svp\_C = 237.3 \) are empirical coefficients that adjust the curve to fit observed data.

### 3. Origin of the Coefficients

The coefficients \( svp\_A \), \( svp\_B \), and \( svp\_C \) are empirical, meaning they were derived from experimental data. Researchers in the field of meteorology and climatology have conducted experiments to measure the saturation vapor pressure at various temperatures, and these coefficients have been adjusted to provide the best fit to observed values across a range of temperatures relevant to Earth's climate.

### 4. Application in Models

In models like APSIM, accurate estimation of humidity and potential evapotranspiration is crucial for simulating plant growth, water usage, and overall agricultural productivity. The Tetens equation provides a relatively simple yet effective way to calculate the saturation vapor pressure from temperature data, which can then be used to derive other important meteorological variables.

### Conclusion

The Tetens coefficients (svp_A = 6.106, svp_B = 17.27, svp_C = 237.3) play a vital role in meteorological and climatological models by enabling the accurate calculation of saturation vapor pressure, a key factor in weather and climate studies. Their empirical derivation ensures that the Tetens equation aligns well with observed data, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in fields related to atmospheric science and agriculture.

Discuss.: 26 June 2013<br>Revised: 6 November 2013 – Accepted: 30 December 2013 – Published: 21 February 2014<br>Abstract. Simulation of land surface processes is problematic in heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution<br>required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability<br>caused by, for example, topography, and the lack of accurate<br>meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required.<br>Gridded data products produced by atmospheric models can<br>fill this gap, however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations. In this study we<br>describe a method that uses the well-resolved description<br>of the atmospheric column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs),<br>to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale<br>subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide highresolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM).<br>The method makes use of an interpolation of pressurelevel data according to topographic height of the subgrid.<br>An elevation and topography correction is used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity<br>at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative<br>humidity fields to describe variability with elevation. Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach.<br>We test the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level<br>data and a set of reference methods, against a large evaluation<br>dataset (up to 210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps.<br>We demonstrate that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in complex terrain, with most significant<br>improvements (with respect to reference methods) seen in<br>variables derived from pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and incoming long-wave radiation.<br>This method may be of use in improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are not possible, due to lack<br>of observations (i.e. remote areas or future periods).<br>1 Introduction<br>Simulations of land-surface processes are important for performing assessments of a wide range of earth systems, under current and possible future climates. This task is problematic in complex terrain due to the inter-connected problems of (i) the high resolution required of model grids to<br>capture strong lateral variability caused by, for example, topography, surface or sub-surface processes (e.g. Gubler et al.,<br>2011; Riseborough et al., 2008; Arnold and Rees, 2009); and<br>consequently, (ii) the lack of accurate meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required (Thornton et al.,<br>1997; Liston and Elder, 2006). This can be due to the lack of<br>meteorological observations (i.e. spatial coverage, temporal<br>extent/continuity, or variables measured are insufficient for<br>purpose) or lack of representative observations where surface variability is high. Gridded data products produced by<br>atmospheric models can, in part, fill this gap (e.g. Frauenfeld, 2005; Pereira-Cardenal et al., 2011; Akhtar et al., 2009;<br>Vu et al., 2012); however, in many cases not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations (i.e.<br>site scale), and therefore require some form of downscaling<br>of variables.<br>Basic downscaling approaches (also referred to as disaggregation), utilise fixed relationships between the coarsegrid fields of atmospheric models and a subgrid surface,<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>388 J. Fiddes and S. Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain<br>that describes a given variable at higher resolution than the<br>coarse-grid. Such approaches developed from the recognised<br>need to represent subgrid surface heterogeneity in climate<br>models and therefore the requirement to disaggregate the<br>coarse-grid climate forcing to the subgrid land-surface (e.g.<br>Dickinson et al., 1986; Wood, 1992; Koster and Suarez,<br>1992; Seth et al., 1994). For example, Giorgi et al. (2003)<br>and Dimri (2009) downscale the temperature field according<br>to the subgrid elevation and a fixed lapse rate. In a coupled<br>system it is important that the coarse-grid mean is conserved<br>by such approaches (Giorgi et al., 2003). More complex approaches to downscaling of climate data can be broadly divided into dynamical or statistical methods (Schmidli et al.,<br>2007) which are used to increase the resolution of largescale climate fields (see for full discussion Wilby and Wigley<br>(1997)). Dynamical methods achieve this by using a limited<br>area model at a higher grid resolution e.g. a regional climate model (RCM), to simulate fine-scale processes which<br>are consistent with large-scale climate fields (Giorgi, 2006).<br>While an RCM grid resolution could be increased further, in<br>practice the effective resolution is limited by the complexity<br>of the numerics that must be solved at each model time step,<br>to the order of 101 km (Kotlarski and Block, 2005). Statistical<br>methods derive empirical relationships between large-scale<br>predictor fields and local observations (Maraun and Wetterhall, 2010). These methods are computationally efficient<br>but the coverage and effective resolution is often limited by<br>the density of observations, especially in mountainous (i.e.<br>data-poor) areas. Additionally, it is unknown whether empirically derived relationships are valid outside the time window used for calibration. To compliment these approaches<br>there is a growing number of physically inspired, computationally efficient approaches that use physical relationships<br>and high-resolution surface information, that is, digital elevation models (DEMs), to distribute fine-scale forcings (meteorological stations or coarse-grid centre point) over wide<br>areas (e.g. Liston and Elder, 2006; Tarboton and Luce, 1996;<br>Marks et al., 1999; Jarosch et al., 2012). These distributed<br>forcings can then be used for full 2-D, point scale or lumped<br>model simulations.<br>Another interesting statistical approach presented by<br>Schomburg et al. (2012) utilises empirical relationships between the atmospheric coarse field and high-resolution surface data to disaggregate variables. The main aim of this<br>work was to improve the forcing of soil–vegetation transfer<br>models either in offline simulations or fully coupled model<br>systems. However, the emphasis of this work is on improving the representation of the land surface, via a distributed<br>forcing, within climate models; moreover, the scheme resolution of 400 m would be too coarse to resolve many surface<br>processes in mountain areas.<br>In complex terrain, topography-based gradients of meteorological variables (i.e. related to elevation, aspect, slope,<br>etc.) can often dominate over horizontal gradients (i.e. latitude/longitude) within a region that is of comparable size<br>to a typical coarse climate cell (e.g. 50–100 km). An example of a method that has successfully encoded this assumption is the PRISM framework (parameter–elevation regressions on independent slopes model) which provides a statistical, topography-based mapping of climate observations<br>(Daly et al., 1994, 2002). We do not neglect the fact that<br>other forms of heterogeneity may be important in modifying surface fluxes, such as surface cover, but it is important<br>to distinguish between surface heterogeneity that clearly affects atmospheric forcing, e.g. the effect of elevation on air<br>temperature, and those characteristics that become important<br>when performing a coupled land-surface–atmosphere simulation (e.g. the effect of soil properties on near-surface air<br>temperature).<br>Climate models provide spatially and temporally continuous fields which are physically consistent and therefore are<br>useful tools for forcing regional-scale land-surface studies<br>(Machguth et al., 2009; Kotlarski et al., 2010). In addition,<br>they provide a thorough description of the atmospheric column by providing data fields at many pressure levels between<br>the earth’s surface and top of the atmosphere.<br>The aim of this study is to develop methods that use<br>the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column<br>provided by climate models, together with high-resolution<br>DEMs, to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a finescale subgrid. The main motivation of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model<br>(LSM), understood here as any process-based surface model<br>that simulates the interface of the land surface/subsurface–<br>atmosphere system. Additionally, the approach should be<br>consistent (methodologically, spatially, temporally) and not<br>reliant on observations. Therefore, the design criteria for this<br>method are (1) it provides high-resolution (< 100 m) downscaling of climate data based primarily on DEM-based information; (2) it is as physically based as possible and therefore has minimal reliance on observations and likely remains<br>valid under future conditions; (3) it employs simple methods<br>which are computationally efficient; (4) it may be used as<br>part of a modelling chain with a lumped representation of the<br>subgrid domain (e.g. Fiddes and Gruber, 2012) for large area<br>applications, as well as 1-D points and 2-D grids. Our approach therefore largely assumes vertical gradients to dominate horizontal gradients within a given model grid box. In<br>this study, we describe this method and its application with<br>ERA-Interim data, a 4-D-VAR reanalysis (3rd generation)<br>which uses the ECMWF climate model, although the method<br>could be equally used with other reanalyses (e.g. NARR,<br>NCEP/NCAR, JRA-55, NASA MERRA, or RCM derived<br>fields). Our methods are then evaluated against a large number of observations over a wide area of complex terrain in<br>the European Alps as well as compared to a set of reference<br>methods. The methods proposed here aim to provide an alternative to statistical methods when observations are not available (remote areas or future periods) and be complimentary<br>Geosci.

The ERA-Interim data assimilation system contains many improvements both in the forecasting model and<br>analysis methodology relative to ECMWF’s previous reanalysis, ERA-40, including the use of 4-dimensional variational analysis, a revised humidity analysis, the use of variational bias correction for satellite data, and other improvements in data handling (Dee et al., 2011). ERA-I provides<br>meteorological data from 1 January 1979 and continues to<br>be extended in near-real time. Gridded products include<br>a large variety of 3-hourly (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00,<br>15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 UTC) grid-surface fields (GRID)<br>and 6-hourly (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC) upperatmosphere products available on 60 pressure levels (PL)<br>with top of the atmosphere located at 1 mb. ERA-I relies on<br>a 4-D-VAR system which uses observations within the windows of 15:00–03:00 UTC and 03:00–15:00 UTC (in the next<br>day) to initialise forecast simulations starting at 00:00 UTC<br>and 12:00 UTC, respectively. In order to allow sufficient<br>spin-up, the first nine hours of the forecast simulations are<br>not used. All fields used in this study where extracted on the<br>ECMWF reduced Gaussian N128 grid (0.75◦ × 0.75◦<br>). Six<br>PLs are used in this study covering the range of 1000–500 mb<br>(1000, 925, 850, 775, 650, 500), corresponding to approximately an elevation range of 150–5500 m a.s.l. ERA-I fields<br>used are listed in Table 1.<br>2.2 Pressure levels below model surface<br>While ERA-I model levels are computed from the model<br>orography surface to top of the atmosphere, pressure-level<br>data is given in the interval 1000 mb (approximately sealevel)–1 mb (top of atmosphere). This means that pressurelevel data exist below the model-grid surface in regions with<br>rugged topography. The extrapolation of fields below the surface uses different methods to those above the model surface. For example, geopotential is extrapolated below the<br>model surface as a function of surface geopotential, surface temperature, temperature at mean sea level, surface<br>pressure and pressure-level value. Temperature is extrapolated below the model surface to a given pressure level as<br>a quadratic function of surface temperature, surface pressure and pressure-level value. Wind and relative humidity are<br>both constant below model surface and equal to the lowest<br>model level values (ECMWF, 2011). Additionally a greater<br>quantity of data is assimilated from above surface observations. Therefore, it can be expected that there is a difference in quality of above/below grid pressure-level data. In<br>addition, measurement locations below grid level are more<br>likely to be in valleys and therefore there will be greater exposure of observations to subgrid processes, not represented<br>by the data. See ECMWF (2011) for full details of extrapolation methods. However, it is difficult to disentangle this effect<br>from the fact that measurements above the model surface are<br>more likely to represent the free atmosphere and, therefore,<br>be more accurately simulated than those strongly effected by<br>topographic effects (e.g. Mesinger et al., 2006; Jarosch et al.,<br>2012) such as inversion layers or topographically modified<br>wind fields. This issue is addressed in the results section.<br>2.3 Evaluation data sets<br>See Table 1 for an overview (by variable) of the evaluation<br>(OBS) data sets used in this study. The MeteoSwiss automatic meteorological network (ANETZ) covers 40 stations<br>(hourly data) ranging 1132–3580 m a.s.l. and represents both<br>high mountain locations and valleys. The IMIS station network of the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research<br>is biased towards high alpine locations (there are few valley<br>stations) but represents topographical heterogeneity in terms<br>of slope and aspect more comprehensively than ANETZ stations. Network elevation range is 1562–3341 m a.s.l. Tenminute measurements from the Alpine Surface Radiation<br>Budget network (ASRB) (Marty et al., 2002) network has<br>9 stations ranging 370–3580 m a.s.l. All OBS data sources<br>where aggregated to daily mean values to enable comparison with ERA-I fields at a common resolution. An additional<br>analysis on diurnal cycles required aggregation at 3-hourly<br>time steps. See Fig. 1 for the locations all stations used in<br>this study and elevation distribution of stations by variable.<br>See Sect. 6.1 for assimilation issues related to evaluation data<br>sets.<br>2.4 Precipitation climatology<br>The CRU Alpine precipitation data set (hereafter referred to<br>as CRU) is used as a climatology in the precipitation scheme.<br>It provides monthly precipitation totals, for the period 1800–<br>2003, gridded at 10 arc-min resolution over the Alpine region. The data set is based on 192 long-term homogenized<br>precipitation series from meteorological stations across the<br>study domain and a high-resolution precipitation climatology for the period 1971–1990. Full details are available in<br>Efthymiadis et al. (2006).<br>2.5 Data quality control<br>OBS values outside acceptable limits were removed automatically by applying physically plausible thresholds to all<br>data sets.

Input pressure-level fields used are, air temperature (Tpl), relative humidity (Rhpl), wind components U and<br>V , which are converted to wind speed (Wspl). Input gridsurface fields are downwelling global radiation (SW↓grid),<br>downwelling long-wave radiation (LW↓grid) and precipitation (Pgrid).

Methods for describing a SUB<br>simulation point used in this study: (a) grid level data (TGRID),<br>(b) extrapolated grid data by reference methods (TSUB(REF)) and<br>(c) TopoSCALE interpolated pressure-level data (TSUB(TSCALE)).<br>modified wind fields can be additionally computed according<br>to a simple wind sub-model (Liston and Sturm, 1998) which<br>adjusts the speeds and directions according to topographic<br>slope and curvature relationships. To perform the wind modification calculations, the local slope, aspect, and topographic<br>curvature (a measure of relative prominence with respect to<br>surrounding terrain) are required (Appendix C2).<br>3.1.2 Radiative fluxes<br>LW↓sub is computed by deriving a cloud component of allsky emissivity at grid level and using Tsub, Rhsub to describe variability with elevation. First, clear-sky emissivity<br>at SUB (<br>cl<br>sub) and GRID (<br>cl<br>grid) are computed according to<br>Konzelmann et al. (1994):<br><br>cl<br>sub/grid = 0.23 + x1(pVsub/grid/Tsub/grid)<br>1/x2<br>, (1)<br>where x1 = 0.43 and x2 = 5.7 (Gubler et al., 2012) and water vapour pressure, pV is a function of Rh (Appendix C3).<br>The all-sky emissivity is computed at GRID using LW↓grid<br>and the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:<br><br>as<br>grid = LW ↓grid /σ T 4<br>grid, (2)<br>where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant of 5.67 ×<br>10−8<br>Js−1 m−2 K<br>−4<br>. We estimate the cloud-based component of emissivity (1) at GRID though subtraction of <br>cl<br>grid<br>from <br>as<br>grid in order to apply this correction directly at SUB.<br>Finally, LW ↓sub can be computed accounting for elevation<br>changes in T and Rh by<br>LW ↓sub=<br><br><br>cl<br>sub + 1<br>σ T 4<br>sub. (3)<br>This approach assumes that cloud emissivity at GRID and<br>SUB elevations are the same, but accounts for reduction of<br>clear-sky emissivity with elevation. This is important as the<br>steepest gradients in LW↓ are often found in clear-sky conditions due to reduction in atmospheric water vapour with<br>elevation. After elevation correction, terrain effects are accounted for by reduction of LW↓sub by multiplication with<br>the sky-view factor, being the fraction of sky that is visible at<br>SUB (Vd). This assumes that LW↓ is isotropic.<br>SW↓sub is computed in a three-step process: (1) partitioning of SW↓grid into direct and diffuse components, (2) elevation adjustment of direct, and (3) topographic correction of<br>both diffuse and direct at point scale. SW↓grid can be partitioned into direct (SW↓<br>dir<br>grid) and and diffuse (SW↓<br>dif<br>grid) components according to the hourly regression model of RuizArias et al. (2010b) which has been developed based on 21<br>stations in Europe and USA (Appendix ). This method uses<br>the clearness index, which is computed by ratioing SW↓grid<br>against irradiance at top of atmosphere, SW↓toa and in doing<br>so estimates a solar transmissivity of the atmospheric column (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that the regression model<br>was developed on hourly data, whereas we apply it to 3 h<br>averages. The vertical gradient of global irradiance between<br>GRID and SUB is mainly determined by the direct component together with difference in the optical path length 1m,<br>assuming that attenuative properties of the atmosphere are<br>constant between the two elevations. Therefore, we apply an<br>elevation correction to SW↓<br>dir<br>grid only, largely following methods of Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010b) (Fig. 3b). First, 1m is computed as<br>1m = 1z cos θz, (4)<br>where 1z is difference in elevation and θz is the solar zenith<br>angle. We can then solve the Beer–Lambert law for direct<br>irradiance to obtain the broadband attenuation coefficient (k):<br>SW ↓<br>dir= SW ↓<br>toa e<br>−km, (5)<br>where m = 1/cos θz (except for large values of θz). The difference in SW↓<br>dir due to elevation difference between GRID<br>and SUB can then be found as<br>1SW ↓<br>dir<br>SW ↓dir ≈ 1 − e<br>−k1z cos θz<br>. (6)<br>Equation (6) shows direct irradiance should increase exponentially with elevation given constant k and elevation-based<br>change in irradiance is maximum when sun is at zenith and<br>zero when sun is at horizon. As the correction is only applicable to clear-sky conditions, it is applied when the air-masscorrected clearness index kt<br>is greater than 0.65 (Perez et al.,<br>1990).<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

This is achieved by computing the illumination angle i, which is the angle the incident direct beam makes with<br>the slope normal and varies with solar zenith θ0 and azimuth<br>angles φ0, and local slope angle S and aspect A:<br>cosisub = cos θz cosS + sinθz sinS cos(φ0 − A).

Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain 393<br>3.1.3 Precipitation<br>Precipitation patterns in mountain regions are driven by<br>a range of complex mechanisms which depend upon, for<br>example, season, geographical climate (maritime, continental) and structure of orography (Leung and Ghan, 1995;<br>Lundquist et al., 2010; Smith and Barstad, 2004). Precipitation is therefore strongly variable in both time and space.<br>Figure 4 gives an overview of the combined climatology and<br>lapse rate approach used to address this problem (e.g. Früh<br>et al., 2006). It should be noted that this routine can also be<br>implemented using only the lapse rate, in order to remove<br>any dependency on climatology data. We acknowledge that<br>the quality of the data set is heavily dependent on density of<br>observations and therefore, better than average results should<br>be expected in our study domain.<br>First, the elevation signal of the climatology data is removed by dividing by the non-linear lapse rate (λp) of Liston<br>and Elder (2006) (Appendix C5), and then normalising to<br>the GRID reference elevation. Pgrid is then disaggregated according to the subgrid variability as described by the normalised climatology (now elevation independent). Each of<br>the ith (in this study 1–25) climatology grid-cells Pclim are<br>normalised by the sum of Pclim contained in each ERA<br>course grid box, resulting in a subgrid disaggregation factor<br>Wsub,<br>Wsub = P<br>i<br>clim /<br>XPclim. (11)<br>In this study we use the CRU climatology but other sources<br>of subgrid observations could be used. Globally, or near globally available data sets (gauge and satellite based) include the<br>Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (Huffman et al., 2007),<br>Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (Beck et al., 2005)<br>and Climatic Research Unit (New et al., 2002) or regionally available such as PRISM (Daly et al., 1994) or even<br>direct observations if available. The product of Pgrid and<br>Wsub generates a subgrid distribution of precipitation at the<br>climatology resolution, that is conservative of the coarsegrid forcing Pgrid. Finally, λp is applied to capture fine-scale<br>precipitation-elevation gradients in order to obtain Psub,<br>Psub = Pgrid · Wsub · λp. (12)<br>It should be noted that this method simply applies a scaling<br>to the precipitation field and does not estimate the precipitation phase (snow–rain partition), this is done by the model<br>which the precipitation field is used to drive.<br>3.2 Reference methods<br>The following is a description of the reference parameterisations with which we compare the current scheme. We do not<br>intend this comparison to be exhaustive, but to merely serve<br>as a reference point, based on common parameterisations.<br>Tgrid is simply extrapolated according to a fixed lapse of<br>6.5 ◦C km−1<br>(e.g. Blandford et al., 2008). Rh is not a linear<br>function of elevation and so the relatively linear dew point<br>temperature (Td) is often used (Liston and Elder, 2006). Rh<br>can be converted to Td as a function of T and pV. In this<br>study Tdgrid is available, so this step is unnecessary.<br>Tdsub can be computed using a variable lapse rate (Kunkel,<br>1989):<br>lapse = λ · c/b, (13)<br>where λ is a vapour pressure coefficient that varies during<br>each month of the year (Kunkel, 1989) and constants b =<br>22.452, c = 272.55 ◦C are given by Buck (1981). Finally,<br>Tdsub is then converted back to Rhsub as a function of Tsub.<br>LW↓ is parameterised as a function of T and pV and cloud<br>cover according to the clear-sky formula of Konzelmann<br>et al. (1994) (Eq. 1) and the all-sky formula of Pirazzini et al.<br>(2000) while accounting for Vd,<br>LW ↓= <br>cl(1 − N<br>p1<br>) +<br><br><br>asN<br>p2<br><br>σ T 4<br>, (14)<br>where <br>cl is given by Eq. (1), N is given by the ERA-I total<br>cloud product (0–1), p1 = 6, p2 = 4 and <br>as = 0.979. Wind<br>is adjusted by 40 % per km (i.e increased above grid level<br>reduced below grid level) (Plüss, 1997). SW↓ is not compared to a reference method as the methods (i.e. partitioning,<br>elevation and topographic correction) used in this study are<br>commonly used elsewhere (i.e. Oliphant, 2003; Schroeder<br>et al., 2009). Precipitation is scaled with a non-linear lapse<br>rate (Liston and Elder, 2006).<br>4 Experiments<br>4.1 Location<br>The study region contains the entire Swiss Alps and uses 19<br>ERA-I grid boxes to cover all observations that are used to<br>evaluate the methods. Switzerland contains one of the most<br>densely observed mountain regions in the world and, therefore, is a suitable region within which to evaluate this method<br>and specifically its performance with respect to vertical information, as it covers a large elevation gradient of 195–<br>4634 m a.s.l.

(15)<br>5 Results<br>In this section results are presented as follows: (1) pressurelevel-based results (T , Rh, Ws, LW↓); (2) surface-based results (SW↓ and precipitation); (3) seasonal error signatures;<br>(4) diurnal cycles; and (5) elevation effects, both absolute and<br>relative to grid level.<br>5.1 Pressure-level-based results<br>Figure 5 gives density scatter plots for the validation data set<br>(OBS) against GRID, REF and TopoSCALE results (MOD)<br>of variables computed based on pressure-level data (with exception of SW↓). A density plot is used because of the large<br>number of points plotted (e.g. ∼ 106<br>in the case of T ).<br>For T , (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant<br>improvement in R, RMSE and BIAS of T with respect<br>to observations. Applying a fixed lapse rate (REF) improves the RMSE by 0.75 ◦C over grid level values whereas<br>TopoSCALE improves RMSE by 2.66 ◦C. The BIAS in REF<br>(1.5) is similar to GRID (1.62), whereas TopoSCALE significantly improves this (−0.02). Bias in TopoSCALE is concentrated at extremes of temperature (i.e. low temperatures<br>are too high and high temperatures are too low).<br>For Rh (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant improvement in the correlation and modest improvement in<br>RMSE (due to the poorly performing cluster at high humidity). There appears to be a high degree of uncertainty in saturated conditions (i.e. measurements at or close to 100 %) in<br>all cases. TopoSCALE shows significant improvement over<br>GRID and REF (approximately the same performance) particular in the interval 0–60 % which is significant for processes such as sublimation which occur in dry atmospheric<br>conditions. Both GRID and REF seem unable to represent<br>humidities less than 30 %. This could possibly be that dry<br>(often well below 30% humidity) Foehn winds are represented in the pressure-level data but absent from surface data.<br>Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series that are possibly related to changing patterns of data<br>assimilation (Fig. 7a). At least one of these artefacts fits<br>to a major data introduction (European wind profilers in<br>2002). Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted to a three<br>year period (1996–1998) that was stable. Comparison of<br>distributions of wind speed show a large improvement of<br>TopoSCALE over GRID especially in the R value and BIAS.<br>There is still a large degree of scatter especially at high wind<br>speeds. The most significant result is an improvement in<br>BIAS with a shift of the distribution to the 1 : 1 line, while<br>the GRID data is not able to represent values greater than<br>5 ms−1<br>.<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●●<br>●<br>●<br>● ● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●

> part3 -------------------<br>Types[edit]<br>2-dimensional diagrams[edit]<br>Pressure vs temperature[edit]<br>A typical phase diagram. The solid green line shows the behaviour of the melting point for most substances; the dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water.  The red lines show the sublimation temperature and the blue line the boiling point, showing how they vary with pressure.<br>The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as water. The axes correspond to the pressure and temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas.<br>The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point.  The open spaces, where the free energy is analytic, correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where phase transitions occur, which are called phase boundaries.<br>In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc = 647.096 K (373.946 °C), pc = 22.064 MPa (217.75 atm) and ρc = 356 kg/m.<br>The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same symmetry group.<br>For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive slope so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase. The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's intermolecular forces. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.<br>Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of hydrogen bonding which requires a greater separation of water molecules. Other exceptions include antimony and bismuth.<br>At very high pressures above 50 GPa (500 000 atm), liquid nitrogen undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition to a polymeric form and becomes denser than solid nitrogen at the same pressure. Under these conditions therefore, solid nitrogen also floats in its liquid.<br>The value of the slope dP/dT is given by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation for fusion (melting)<br>d<br><br>P<br><br><br><br>d<br><br>T<br><br><br><br>=<br><br><br><br>Δ<br><br>H<br><br>fus<br><br><br><br><br>T<br><br>Δ<br><br>V<br><br>fus<br><br><br><br><br><br>,<br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} P}{\mathrm {d} T}}={\frac {\Delta H_{\text{fus}}}{T\,\Delta V_{\text{fus}}}},}<br>where ΔHfus is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and ΔVfus is the volume change for fusion. For most substances ΔVfus is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ΔVfus is negative so that the slope is negative.<br>Other thermodynamic properties[edit]<br>In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams.  Examples of such thermodynamic properties include specific volume, specific enthalpy, or specific entropy.  For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (T vs. s) for water/steam or for a refrigerant are commonly used to illustrate thermodynamic cycles such as a Carnot cycle, Rankine cycle, or vapor-compression refrigeration cycle.<br>Any two thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes of a two-dimensional diagram. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines – curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these iso-lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.<br>Chart in U.S. units<br><br><br>enthalpy–entropy (h–s) diagram for steam<br><br><br><br>pressure–enthalpy (p–h) diagram for steam<br><br><br><br>temperature–entropy (T–s) diagram for steam

> th and 21st centuries, with the advent of computer models and big data, meteorology has become increasingly dependent on numerical methods and computer simulations. This has greatly improved weather forecasting and climate predictions. Additionally, meteorology has expanded to include other areas such as air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climatology. The advancement in observational, theoretical and computational technologies has enabled ever more accurate weather predictions and understanding of weather pattern and air pollution. In current time, with the advancement in weather forecasting and satellite technology, meteorology has become an integral part of everyday life, and is used for many purposes such as

> gas law.<br>The Clausius–Clapeyron relation, in chemical thermodynamics, specifies the temperature dependence of pressure, most importantly vapor pressure, at a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent.  It's named after Rudolf Clausius[1] and Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron.[2] However, this relation was in fact originally derived by Sadi Carnot in his Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, which was published in 1824 but largely ignored until it was rediscovered by Clausius, Clape
