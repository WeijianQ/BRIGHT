## Original Question

*Which plant is the most efficient in making oxygen for it's weight? I want to think it is the greenest plant with more leaves and least trunk in full sun?*

The essential problem here is identifying which plant species is the most efficient at producing oxygen relative to its weight. This involves understanding the factors that influence photosynthesis efficiency and oxygen production in plants. To address this, we need to consider several key aspects:

1. **Photosynthesis Efficiency:** Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct. The efficiency of this process can vary significantly among different plant species, depending on factors such as leaf area, chlorophyll content, and the plant's ability to utilize light and carbon dioxide.

2. **Leaf Area and Structure:** Plants with a larger leaf area relative to their total biomass are likely to be more efficient at photosynthesis because they have more surface area to absorb sunlight and exchange gases. This suggests that plants with more leaves and less trunk, as mentioned, could indeed be more efficient at producing oxygen for their weight. Additionally, the structure and thickness of the leaves can affect light absorption and gas exchange rates.

3. **Chlorophyll Content:** Chlorophyll is the pigment that gives plants their green color and plays a critical role in photosynthesis by absorbing light. Plants with a higher chlorophyll content may be more efficient at converting light energy into chemical energy, leading to higher oxygen production rates.

4. **Environmental Conditions:** The efficiency of photosynthesis is also influenced by environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, and water availability. Plants that are adapted to full sun conditions are generally more efficient at photosynthesis in bright light compared to shade-tolerant species. Therefore, a plant that thrives in full sun, as specified, is likely to be among the more efficient oxygen producers when all other factors are equal.

Given these considerations, the most efficient oxygen-producing plants for their weight are likely to be small, fast-growing plants with a high leaf area to biomass ratio, high chlorophyll content, and adaptations to full sun exposure. Some examples might include:

- **Microalgae:** Though not technically plants, microalgae like Spirulina are incredibly efficient at photosynthesis and oxygen production relative to their biomass. They have a high surface area to volume ratio and can grow rapidly under optimal conditions.

- **Mosses and Ferns:** These plants often have a high leaf area relative to their size and can be quite efficient at photosynthesis, especially in moist, bright environments.

- **Grasses and Herbaceous Plants:** Certain fast-growing grasses and herbaceous plants can also be highly efficient oxygen producers for their weight, thanks to their high growth rate and large leaf area.

In conclusion, while the specific "most efficient" plant may vary based on the criteria used (e.g., oxygen production per unit weight vs. per unit area), small, leafy plants that grow quickly, have a high chlorophyll content, and are adapted to full sun conditions are likely candidates. Researching specific oxygen production rates of plants could provide more precise answers, but such data may be limited and vary based on experimental conditions.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton which are r-strategists that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as forests, are K-strategists that grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.<br>Among the phytoplankton at the base of the marine food web are members from a phylum of bacteria called cyanobacteria. Marine cyanobacteria include the smallest known photosynthetic organisms. The smallest of all, Prochlorococcus, is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across. In terms of individual numbers, Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful species on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater can contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, there are estimated to be several octillion (10) individuals. Prochlorococcus is ubiquitous between 40Â°N and 40Â°S and dominates in the oligotrophic (nutrient poor) regions of the oceans. The bacterium accounts for an estimated 20% of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, and forms part of the base of the ocean food chain.

> from CO2 fertilization effect.[edit]<br>The CO2 fertilization effect or carbon fertilization effect causes an increased rate of photosynthesis while limiting leaf transpiration in plants. Both processes result from increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).[89][90]  The carbon fertilization effect varies depending on plant species, air and soil temperature, and availability of water and nutrients.[91][92] Net primary productivity (NPP) might positively respond to the carbon fertilization effect.[93] Although, evidence shows that enhanced rates of photosynthesis in plants due to CO2 fertilization do
