## Original Question

*I know volcanologists study volcanoes. Is there a subdiscipline that only studies maga or lava? A magmatologist?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem is to determine if there is a specialized subdiscipline within volcanology or geology that exclusively focuses on the study of magma or lava, potentially referred to as "magmatology."

**Step 1: Understanding Volcanology**

Volcanology is the scientific study of volcanoes, lava, magma, and related geological, geophysical, and geochemical phenomena. This discipline involves understanding the formation, activity, and classification of volcanoes, as well as predicting eruptions and studying volcanic gases, rocks, and flows. Volcanologists aim to mitigate volcanic hazards to protect lives and property.

**Step 2: Identifying Subdisciplines in Geosciences**

Within the broad field of geosciences, there are many specialized areas of study. These include, but are not limited to, petrology (the study of rocks), seismology (the study of earthquakes and seismic waves), and geochemistry (the study of the chemical composition of Earth materials). Each of these fields can intersect with volcanology, as they all can involve aspects of volcanic activity and its products.

**Step 3: The Concept of "Magmatology"**

While there isn't a widely recognized subdiscipline formally called "magmatology," the study of magma is a critical part of volcanology and petrology. Petrology itself is divided into three main branches: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology. Igneous petrology specifically deals with the study of igneous rocks and processes, which directly includes the formation, cooling, and crystallization of magma and lava. Thus, one could argue that the study of magma and lava falls primarily under the purview of igneous petrology.

**Step 4: Magma Dynamics and Geochemistry**

Another aspect to consider is the study of magma dynamics and geochemistry, which involves understanding the physical and chemical properties of magma, including its temperature, viscosity, composition, and behavior as it moves through the Earth's crust. This is a critical area of research for predicting volcanic eruptions and understanding the creation of igneous rock formations.

**Conclusion**

While the term "magmatology" is not officially recognized as a separate subdiscipline, the study of magma and lava is an integral part of several existing fields within geology and volcanology, particularly igneous petrology and geochemistry. Researchers in these areas work to understand the complexities of magma from its origin, evolution, and eventual eruption as lava, contributing valuable knowledge towards volcanic risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

An eruption of highly viscous (very sticky) magma tends to produce steep-sided volcanoes with slopes that are about 30–35°. That’s because the viscous volcanic material doesn’t flow that far from where it is erupted, so it builds up in layers forming a cone-shaped volcano known as a stratovolcano. Shield volcanoes, on the other hand, have gentle slopes that are less than 10° and erupt more fluid lavas called basalt. When a
