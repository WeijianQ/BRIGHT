## Original Question

*If I have wind speeds at 80m and 120m above the surface and I am interested in approximating the speed at 100m, is it valid to just average the 80 and 120 speeds? In other words, should I expect wind speed to be a linear function of height or would a nonlinear function be more appropriate?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here involves determining the most accurate method to estimate wind speed at a certain height (100m in this case) given wind speed measurements at two different heights (80m and 120m). The question is whether wind speed changes linearly with height, which would justify simply averaging the two speeds, or if a nonlinear relationship would provide a more accurate estimation.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Wind Speed Variation with Height**:
   - Wind speed generally increases with height above the ground due to the decrease in surface friction. The exact rate at which wind speed increases, however, is not constant and can be influenced by various factors such as surface roughness, atmospheric stability, and temperature gradients.

2. **Logarithmic Wind Profile**:
   - Empirically, wind profiles near the surface of the Earth (up to a few hundred meters) often follow a logarithmic relationship rather than a linear one. This is due to the nature of atmospheric boundary layer flow over a rough surface. The logarithmic wind profile equation, which is derived from the law of the wall in fluid mechanics, suggests that wind speed increases logarithmically with height from the ground.

3. **Power Law Profile**:
   - Another approach to estimate wind speed at different heights is the power law profile, which also acknowledges the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and height. The power law exponent varies with atmospheric stability but provides a simpler way to estimate wind speed changes with height compared to the logarithmic profile.

4. **Applicability of Averaging**:
   - Averaging the wind speeds at 80m and 120m to estimate the wind speed at 100m assumes a linear relationship between wind speed and height, which, as mentioned, is not generally the case due to the factors affecting wind speed profiles.
   - However, since the heights in question (80m, 100m, and 120m) are relatively close, and the atmospheric conditions (e.g., surface roughness, stability) between these heights might not vary significantly, a simple average might provide a rough approximation. Still, this method neglects the actual physics of the atmospheric boundary layer.

5. **Recommendation**:
   - For a more accurate estimation, employing a model that accounts for the nonlinear relationship between wind speed and height is recommended. This could be a logarithmic wind profile or a power law, depending on the available data (e.g., surface roughness, stability classes) and the specific application.
   - If detailed data for a more complex model is not available, and precision is not critical, averaging could serve as a preliminary approximation, with the understanding that it simplifies the complex interaction between wind speed and height.

### Conclusion

While simply averaging the wind speeds at 80m and 120m to estimate the speed at 100m might offer a convenient approximation, it does not accurately reflect the complex, nonlinear relationship between wind speed and height. For applications requiring more precision, utilizing a model based on empirical data (like the logarithmic or power law profiles) is advisable. This approach would better account for the variable factors affecting wind speed at different heights and provide a more accurate estimation.

Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero due to the no-slip condition. Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.<br>This turbulence causes vertical mixing between the air moving horizontally at various levels, which has an effect on the dispersion of pollutants, dust and airborne sand and soil particles.<br>The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness. Wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types. Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground, retard movement of the air near the surface, reducing wind velocity. Because of the relatively smooth water surface, wind speeds do not decrease as much close to the sea as they do on land. Over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the geostrophic wind speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%.<br>For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the "gradient height" and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the "gradient wind speed". For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.<br>Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height, Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so, with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m.<br>The shearing of the wind is usually three-dimensional, that is, there is also a change in direction between the 'free' pressure-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the Ekman spiral effect. <br>The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10° over open water, to 30° over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40°-50° over land at night when the wind speed is very low.<br>After sundown the wind gradient near the surface increases, with the increasing stability.<br>Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically, increasing the wind gradient. The magnitude of the wind gradient is largely influenced by the height of the convective boundary layer and this effect is even larger over the sea, where there is no diurnal variation of the height of the boundary layer as there is over land.<br>In the convective boundary layer, strong mixing diminishes vertical wind gradient.

If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,<br>or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding<br>the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the<br>gradient.<br>When landing, wind gradient is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.<br>Wind gradient is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.<br><br>Further information: Gliding<br>Sailing[edit]<br>In sailing, wind gradient affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed to the sail at different heights along the mast. The direction also varies with height, but sailors refer to this as "wind shear."<br>The mast head instruments indication of apparent wind speed and direction is different from what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist in the design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.<br>According to one source, the wind gradient is not significant for sailboats when the wind is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over the height of a sailboat's mast).  According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface.  This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.<br>In kitesurfing, the wind gradient is even more important, because the power kite is flown on 20-30m lines, and the kitesurfer can use the kite to jump off the water, bringing the kite to even greater heights above the sea surface.<br>Sound propagation[edit]<br>Wind gradient can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and must be considered in the design of noise barriers.<br>When wind speed increases with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener from the source will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels downwind of the barrier.  These effects were first quantified in the field of highway engineering to address variations of noise barrier efficacy in the 1960s.<br>When the sun warms the Earth's surface, there is a negative temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.<br>A wind speed gradient of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature lapse rate of 7.5 °C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.<br>There will usually be both a wind gradient and a temperature gradient. In that case, the effects of both might add together or subtract depending on the situation and the location of the observer.<br>The wind gradient and the temperature gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, but not in a sound shadow between them.<br>In the case of transverse sound propagation, wind gradients do not sensibly modify sound propagation relative to the windless condition; the gradient effect appears to be important only in upwind and downwind configurations.<br>For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br>=<br>U<br>(<br>0<br>)<br><br>h<br><br>ζ<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(h)=U(0)h^{\zeta }}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>d<br>U<br><br><br>d<br>h<br><br><br><br>=<br>ζ<br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br><br>h<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dh}}=\zeta {\frac {U(h)}{h}}}<br><br><br>where:<br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(h)}<br><br> = speed of the wind at height <br><br><br><br>h<br><br><br>{\displaystyle h}<br><br>, and <br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>0<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(0)}<br><br> is a constant<br><br><br><br><br>ζ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \zeta }<br><br> = exponential coefficient based on ground surface roughness, typically between 0.08 and 0.52<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>d<br>U<br><br><br>d<br>h<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dh}}}<br><br> = expected wind gradient at height <br><br><br><br>h<br><br><br>{\displaystyle h}<br>In the 1862 American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.<br>Scientists have understood the effect of wind gradient upon refraction of sound since the mid-1900s; however, with the advent of the U.S. Noise Control Act, this refractive phenomenon was widely used beginning in the early 1970s, chiefly in the consideration of noise propagation from highways and resultant design of transportation facilities.<br><br>Further information: Sound<br>Wind gradient soaring[edit]<br>This albatross is an expert in dynamic soaring using the wind gradient.<br>Wind gradient soaring, also called dynamic soaring, is a technique used by soaring birds including albatrosses.

Such approaches developed from the recognised<br>need to represent subgrid surface heterogeneity in climate<br>models and therefore the requirement to disaggregate the<br>coarse-grid climate forcing to the subgrid land-surface (e.g.<br>Dickinson et al., 1986; Wood, 1992; Koster and Suarez,<br>1992; Seth et al., 1994). For example, Giorgi et al. (2003)<br>and Dimri (2009) downscale the temperature field according<br>to the subgrid elevation and a fixed lapse rate. In a coupled<br>system it is important that the coarse-grid mean is conserved<br>by such approaches (Giorgi et al., 2003). More complex approaches to downscaling of climate data can be broadly divided into dynamical or statistical methods (Schmidli et al.,<br>2007) which are used to increase the resolution of largescale climate fields (see for full discussion Wilby and Wigley<br>(1997)). Dynamical methods achieve this by using a limited<br>area model at a higher grid resolution e.g. a regional climate model (RCM), to simulate fine-scale processes which<br>are consistent with large-scale climate fields (Giorgi, 2006).<br>While an RCM grid resolution could be increased further, in<br>practice the effective resolution is limited by the complexity<br>of the numerics that must be solved at each model time step,<br>to the order of 101 km (Kotlarski and Block, 2005). Statistical<br>methods derive empirical relationships between large-scale<br>predictor fields and local observations (Maraun and Wetterhall, 2010). These methods are computationally efficient<br>but the coverage and effective resolution is often limited by<br>the density of observations, especially in mountainous (i.e.<br>data-poor) areas. Additionally, it is unknown whether empirically derived relationships are valid outside the time window used for calibration. To compliment these approaches<br>there is a growing number of physically inspired, computationally efficient approaches that use physical relationships<br>and high-resolution surface information, that is, digital elevation models (DEMs), to distribute fine-scale forcings (meteorological stations or coarse-grid centre point) over wide<br>areas (e.g. Liston and Elder, 2006; Tarboton and Luce, 1996;<br>Marks et al., 1999; Jarosch et al., 2012). These distributed<br>forcings can then be used for full 2-D, point scale or lumped<br>model simulations.<br>Another interesting statistical approach presented by<br>Schomburg et al. (2012) utilises empirical relationships between the atmospheric coarse field and high-resolution surface data to disaggregate variables. The main aim of this<br>work was to improve the forcing of soil–vegetation transfer<br>models either in offline simulations or fully coupled model<br>systems. However, the emphasis of this work is on improving the representation of the land surface, via a distributed<br>forcing, within climate models; moreover, the scheme resolution of 400 m would be too coarse to resolve many surface<br>processes in mountain areas.<br>In complex terrain, topography-based gradients of meteorological variables (i.e. related to elevation, aspect, slope,<br>etc.) can often dominate over horizontal gradients (i.e. latitude/longitude) within a region that is of comparable size<br>to a typical coarse climate cell (e.g. 50–100 km). An example of a method that has successfully encoded this assumption is the PRISM framework (parameter–elevation regressions on independent slopes model) which provides a statistical, topography-based mapping of climate observations<br>(Daly et al., 1994, 2002). We do not neglect the fact that<br>other forms of heterogeneity may be important in modifying surface fluxes, such as surface cover, but it is important<br>to distinguish between surface heterogeneity that clearly affects atmospheric forcing, e.g. the effect of elevation on air<br>temperature, and those characteristics that become important<br>when performing a coupled land-surface–atmosphere simulation (e.g. the effect of soil properties on near-surface air<br>temperature).<br>Climate models provide spatially and temporally continuous fields which are physically consistent and therefore are<br>useful tools for forcing regional-scale land-surface studies<br>(Machguth et al., 2009; Kotlarski et al., 2010). In addition,<br>they provide a thorough description of the atmospheric column by providing data fields at many pressure levels between<br>the earth’s surface and top of the atmosphere.<br>The aim of this study is to develop methods that use<br>the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column<br>provided by climate models, together with high-resolution<br>DEMs, to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a finescale subgrid. The main motivation of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model<br>(LSM), understood here as any process-based surface model<br>that simulates the interface of the land surface/subsurface–<br>atmosphere system. Additionally, the approach should be<br>consistent (methodologically, spatially, temporally) and not<br>reliant on observations. Therefore, the design criteria for this<br>method are (1) it provides high-resolution (< 100 m) downscaling of climate data based primarily on DEM-based information; (2) it is as physically based as possible and therefore has minimal reliance on observations and likely remains<br>valid under future conditions; (3) it employs simple methods<br>which are computationally efficient; (4) it may be used as<br>part of a modelling chain with a lumped representation of the<br>subgrid domain (e.g. Fiddes and Gruber, 2012) for large area<br>applications, as well as 1-D points and 2-D grids. Our approach therefore largely assumes vertical gradients to dominate horizontal gradients within a given model grid box. In<br>this study, we describe this method and its application with<br>ERA-Interim data, a 4-D-VAR reanalysis (3rd generation)<br>which uses the ECMWF climate model, although the method<br>could be equally used with other reanalyses (e.g. NARR,<br>NCEP/NCAR, JRA-55, NASA MERRA, or RCM derived<br>fields). Our methods are then evaluated against a large number of observations over a wide area of complex terrain in<br>the European Alps as well as compared to a set of reference<br>methods. The methods proposed here aim to provide an alternative to statistical methods when observations are not available (remote areas or future periods) and be complimentary<br>Geosci.

The ERA-Interim data assimilation system contains many improvements both in the forecasting model and<br>analysis methodology relative to ECMWF’s previous reanalysis, ERA-40, including the use of 4-dimensional variational analysis, a revised humidity analysis, the use of variational bias correction for satellite data, and other improvements in data handling (Dee et al., 2011). ERA-I provides<br>meteorological data from 1 January 1979 and continues to<br>be extended in near-real time. Gridded products include<br>a large variety of 3-hourly (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00,<br>15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 UTC) grid-surface fields (GRID)<br>and 6-hourly (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC) upperatmosphere products available on 60 pressure levels (PL)<br>with top of the atmosphere located at 1 mb. ERA-I relies on<br>a 4-D-VAR system which uses observations within the windows of 15:00–03:00 UTC and 03:00–15:00 UTC (in the next<br>day) to initialise forecast simulations starting at 00:00 UTC<br>and 12:00 UTC, respectively. In order to allow sufficient<br>spin-up, the first nine hours of the forecast simulations are<br>not used. All fields used in this study where extracted on the<br>ECMWF reduced Gaussian N128 grid (0.75◦ × 0.75◦<br>). Six<br>PLs are used in this study covering the range of 1000–500 mb<br>(1000, 925, 850, 775, 650, 500), corresponding to approximately an elevation range of 150–5500 m a.s.l. ERA-I fields<br>used are listed in Table 1.<br>2.2 Pressure levels below model surface<br>While ERA-I model levels are computed from the model<br>orography surface to top of the atmosphere, pressure-level<br>data is given in the interval 1000 mb (approximately sealevel)–1 mb (top of atmosphere). This means that pressurelevel data exist below the model-grid surface in regions with<br>rugged topography. The extrapolation of fields below the surface uses different methods to those above the model surface. For example, geopotential is extrapolated below the<br>model surface as a function of surface geopotential, surface temperature, temperature at mean sea level, surface<br>pressure and pressure-level value. Temperature is extrapolated below the model surface to a given pressure level as<br>a quadratic function of surface temperature, surface pressure and pressure-level value. Wind and relative humidity are<br>both constant below model surface and equal to the lowest<br>model level values (ECMWF, 2011). Additionally a greater<br>quantity of data is assimilated from above surface observations. Therefore, it can be expected that there is a difference in quality of above/below grid pressure-level data. In<br>addition, measurement locations below grid level are more<br>likely to be in valleys and therefore there will be greater exposure of observations to subgrid processes, not represented<br>by the data. See ECMWF (2011) for full details of extrapolation methods. However, it is difficult to disentangle this effect<br>from the fact that measurements above the model surface are<br>more likely to represent the free atmosphere and, therefore,<br>be more accurately simulated than those strongly effected by<br>topographic effects (e.g. Mesinger et al., 2006; Jarosch et al.,<br>2012) such as inversion layers or topographically modified<br>wind fields. This issue is addressed in the results section.<br>2.3 Evaluation data sets<br>See Table 1 for an overview (by variable) of the evaluation<br>(OBS) data sets used in this study. The MeteoSwiss automatic meteorological network (ANETZ) covers 40 stations<br>(hourly data) ranging 1132–3580 m a.s.l. and represents both<br>high mountain locations and valleys. The IMIS station network of the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research<br>is biased towards high alpine locations (there are few valley<br>stations) but represents topographical heterogeneity in terms<br>of slope and aspect more comprehensively than ANETZ stations. Network elevation range is 1562–3341 m a.s.l. Tenminute measurements from the Alpine Surface Radiation<br>Budget network (ASRB) (Marty et al., 2002) network has<br>9 stations ranging 370–3580 m a.s.l. All OBS data sources<br>where aggregated to daily mean values to enable comparison with ERA-I fields at a common resolution. An additional<br>analysis on diurnal cycles required aggregation at 3-hourly<br>time steps.

The data set is based on 192 long-term homogenized<br>precipitation series from meteorological stations across the<br>study domain and a high-resolution precipitation climatology for the period 1971–1990.

To perform the wind modification calculations, the local slope, aspect, and topographic<br>curvature (a measure of relative prominence with respect to<br>surrounding terrain) are required (Appendix C2).<br>3.1.2 Radiative fluxes<br>LW↓sub is computed by deriving a cloud component of allsky emissivity at grid level and using Tsub, Rhsub to describe variability with elevation. First, clear-sky emissivity<br>at SUB (<br>cl<br>sub) and GRID (<br>cl<br>grid) are computed according to<br>Konzelmann et al. (1994):<br><br>cl<br>sub/grid = 0.23 + x1(pVsub/grid/Tsub/grid)<br>1/x2<br>, (1)<br>where x1 = 0.43 and x2 = 5.7 (Gubler et al., 2012) and water vapour pressure, pV is a function of Rh (Appendix C3).<br>The all-sky emissivity is computed at GRID using LW↓grid<br>and the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:<br><br>as<br>grid = LW ↓grid /σ T 4<br>grid, (2)<br>where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant of 5.67 ×<br>10−8<br>Js−1 m−2 K<br>−4<br>. We estimate the cloud-based component of emissivity (1) at GRID though subtraction of <br>cl<br>grid<br>from <br>as<br>grid in order to apply this correction directly at SUB.<br>Finally, LW ↓sub can be computed accounting for elevation<br>changes in T and Rh by<br>LW ↓sub=<br><br><br>cl<br>sub + 1<br>σ T 4<br>sub. (3)<br>This approach assumes that cloud emissivity at GRID and<br>SUB elevations are the same, but accounts for reduction of<br>clear-sky emissivity with elevation. This is important as the<br>steepest gradients in LW↓ are often found in clear-sky conditions due to reduction in atmospheric water vapour with<br>elevation. After elevation correction, terrain effects are accounted for by reduction of LW↓sub by multiplication with<br>the sky-view factor, being the fraction of sky that is visible at<br>SUB (Vd). This assumes that LW↓ is isotropic.<br>SW↓sub is computed in a three-step process: (1) partitioning of SW↓grid into direct and diffuse components, (2) elevation adjustment of direct, and (3) topographic correction of<br>both diffuse and direct at point scale. SW↓grid can be partitioned into direct (SW↓<br>dir<br>grid) and and diffuse (SW↓<br>dif<br>grid) components according to the hourly regression model of RuizArias et al. (2010b) which has been developed based on 21<br>stations in Europe and USA (Appendix ). This method uses<br>the clearness index, which is computed by ratioing SW↓grid<br>against irradiance at top of atmosphere, SW↓toa and in doing<br>so estimates a solar transmissivity of the atmospheric column (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that the regression model<br>was developed on hourly data, whereas we apply it to 3 h<br>averages. The vertical gradient of global irradiance between<br>GRID and SUB is mainly determined by the direct component together with difference in the optical path length 1m,<br>assuming that attenuative properties of the atmosphere are<br>constant between the two elevations. Therefore, we apply an<br>elevation correction to SW↓<br>dir<br>grid only, largely following methods of Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010b) (Fig. 3b). First, 1m is computed as<br>1m = 1z cos θz, (4)<br>where 1z is difference in elevation and θz is the solar zenith<br>angle. We can then solve the Beer–Lambert law for direct<br>irradiance to obtain the broadband attenuation coefficient (k):<br>SW ↓<br>dir= SW ↓<br>toa e<br>−km, (5)<br>where m = 1/cos θz (except for large values of θz). The difference in SW↓<br>dir due to elevation difference between GRID<br>and SUB can then be found as<br>1SW ↓<br>dir<br>SW ↓dir ≈ 1 − e<br>−k1z cos θz<br>. (6)<br>Equation (6) shows direct irradiance should increase exponentially with elevation given constant k and elevation-based<br>change in irradiance is maximum when sun is at zenith and<br>zero when sun is at horizon. As the correction is only applicable to clear-sky conditions, it is applied when the air-masscorrected clearness index kt<br>is greater than 0.65 (Perez et al.,<br>1990).<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Precipitation is therefore strongly variable in both time and space.<br>Figure 4 gives an overview of the combined climatology and<br>lapse rate approach used to address this problem (e.g. Früh<br>et al., 2006).

We acknowledge that<br>the quality of the data set is heavily dependent on density of<br>observations and therefore, better than average results should<br>be expected in our study domain.<br>First, the elevation signal of the climatology data is removed by dividing by the non-linear lapse rate (λp) of Liston<br>and Elder (2006) (Appendix C5), and then normalising to<br>the GRID reference elevation. Pgrid is then disaggregated according to the subgrid variability as described by the normalised climatology (now elevation independent). Each of<br>the ith (in this study 1–25) climatology grid-cells Pclim are<br>normalised by the sum of Pclim contained in each ERA<br>course grid box, resulting in a subgrid disaggregation factor<br>Wsub,<br>Wsub = P<br>i<br>clim /<br>XPclim.

Wind<br>is adjusted by 40 % per km (i.e increased above grid level<br>reduced below grid level) (Plüss, 1997). SW↓ is not compared to a reference method as the methods (i.e. partitioning,<br>elevation and topographic correction) used in this study are<br>commonly used elsewhere (i.e. Oliphant, 2003; Schroeder<br>et al., 2009).

A density plot is used because of the large<br>number of points plotted (e.g. ∼ 106<br>in the case of T ).<br>For T , (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant<br>improvement in R, RMSE and BIAS of T with respect<br>to observations. Applying a fixed lapse rate (REF) improves the RMSE by 0.75 ◦C over grid level values whereas<br>TopoSCALE improves RMSE by 2.66 ◦C. The BIAS in REF<br>(1.5) is similar to GRID (1.62), whereas TopoSCALE significantly improves this (−0.02). Bias in TopoSCALE is concentrated at extremes of temperature (i.e. low temperatures<br>are too high and high temperatures are too low).<br>For Rh (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant improvement in the correlation and modest improvement in<br>RMSE (due to the poorly performing cluster at high humidity). There appears to be a high degree of uncertainty in saturated conditions (i.e. measurements at or close to 100 %) in<br>all cases. TopoSCALE shows significant improvement over<br>GRID and REF (approximately the same performance) particular in the interval 0–60 % which is significant for processes such as sublimation which occur in dry atmospheric<br>conditions.

> part2 -------------------<br>Simple explanation[edit]<br>Surface friction forces the surface wind to slow and turn near the surface of the Earth, blowing directly towards the low pressure, when compared to the winds in the nearly frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This bottom layer, where surface friction slows the wind and changes the wind direction, is known as the planetary boundary layer. Daytime solar heating due to insolation thickens the boundary layer, as air warmed by contact with the Earth's hot surface rises up and increasingly mixes with air higher up. Radiative cooling overnight gradually decouples the winds at the surface from the winds above the boundary layer, increasing vertical wind shear near the surface, also known as wind gradient.

> part1 -------------------<br>In common usage, wind gradient, more specifically wind speed gradient<br>or wind velocity gradient,<br>or alternatively shear wind,<br>is the vertical component of the gradient of the mean horizontal wind speed in the lower atmosphere. It is the rate of increase of wind strength with unit increase in height above ground level. In metric units, it is often measured in units of meters per second of speed, per kilometer of height (m/s/km), which reduces inverse milliseconds (ms), a unit also used for shear rate.

> part3 -------------------<br>Characterization[edit]<br><br>See also: Ekman layer, Ekman spiral, Planetary boundary layer, and Surface layer<br>Typically, due to aerodynamic drag, there is a wind gradient in the wind flow, especially in the first few hundred meters above the Earth's surface—the surface layer of the planetary boundary layer. Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero due to the no-slip condition. Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.<br>This turbulence causes vertical mixing between the air moving horizontally at various levels, which has an effect on the dispersion of pollutants, dust and airborne sand and soil particles.<br>The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness. Wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types. Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground, retard movement of the air near the surface, reducing wind velocity. Because of the relatively smooth water surface, wind speeds do not decrease as much close to the sea as they do on land. Over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the geostrophic wind speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%.<br>For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the "gradient height" and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the "gradient wind speed". For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.<br>Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height, Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so, with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m.<br>The shearing of the wind is usually three-dimensional, that is, there is also a change in direction between the 'free' pressure-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the Ekman spiral effect. <br>The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10° over open water, to 30° over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40°-50° over land at night when the wind speed is very low.<br>After sundown the wind gradient near the surface increases, with the increasing stability.<br>Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically, increasing the wind gradient. The magnitude of the wind gradient is largely influenced by the height of the convective boundary layer and this effect is even larger over the sea, where there is no diurnal variation of the height of the boundary layer as there is over land.<br>In the convective boundary layer, strong mixing diminishes vertical wind gradient.

Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel, which results in asymmetric load. The wind gradient can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two-bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind gradient over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in windparks which are placed in (shallow) seas. It would be preferable for wind turbines to be tested in a wind tunnel simulating the wind gradient that they will eventually see, but this is rarely done.<br>For wind turbine engineering, a polynomial variation in wind speed with height can be defined relative to wind measured at a reference height of 10 meters as:<br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>v<br><br>w<br><br><br>(<br>h<br>)<br>=<br><br>v<br><br>10<br><br><br>⋅<br><br><br>(<br><br><br>h<br><br>h<br><br>10<br><br><br><br><br>)<br><br><br>a<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle \ v_{w}(h)=v_{10}\cdot \left({\frac {h}{h_{10}}}\right)^{a}}<br><br><br>where:<br>v<br><br>w<br><br><br>(<br>h<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle v_{w}(h)}<br><br> = velocity of the wind [m/s], at height <br><br><br><br>h<br><br><br>{\displaystyle h}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>v<br><br>10<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle v_{10}}<br><br> = velocity of the wind [m/s], at height <br><br><br><br><br>h<br><br>10<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle h_{10}}<br><br> = 10 meters<br><br><br><br><br>a<br><br><br>{\displaystyle a}<br><br> = Hellmann exponent<br>The Hellmann exponent depends upon the coastal location and the shape of the terrain on the ground, and the stability of the air.

If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,<br>or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding<br>the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the<br>gradient.<br>When landing, wind gradient is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.<br>Wind gradient is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.<br><br>Further information: Gliding<br>Sailing[edit]<br>In sailing, wind gradient affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed to the sail at different heights along the mast. The direction also varies with height, but sailors refer to this as "wind shear."<br>The mast head instruments indication of apparent wind speed and direction is different from what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist in the design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.<br>According to one source, the wind gradient is not significant for sailboats when the wind is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over the height of a sailboat's mast).  According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface.  This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.<br>In kitesurfing, the wind gradient is even more important, because the power kite is flown on 20-30m lines, and the kitesurfer can use the kite to jump off the water, bringing the kite to even greater heights above the sea surface.<br>Sound propagation[edit]<br>Wind gradient can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and must be considered in the design of noise barriers.<br>When wind speed increases with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener from the source will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels downwind of the barrier.  These effects were first quantified in the field of highway engineering to address variations of noise barrier efficacy in the 1960s.<br>When the sun warms the Earth's surface, there is a negative temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.<br>A wind speed gradient of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature lapse rate of 7.5 °C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.<br>There will usually be both a wind gradient and a temperature gradient. In that case, the effects of both might add together or subtract depending on the situation and the location of the observer.<br>The wind gradient and the temperature gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, but not in a sound shadow between them.<br>In the case of transverse sound propagation, wind gradients do not sensibly modify sound propagation relative to the windless condition; the gradient effect appears to be important only in upwind and downwind configurations.<br>For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:<br><br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br>=<br>U<br>(<br>0<br>)<br><br>h<br><br>ζ<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(h)=U(0)h^{\zeta }}<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>d<br>U<br><br><br>d<br>h<br><br><br><br>=<br>ζ<br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br><br>h<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dh}}=\zeta {\frac {U(h)}{h}}}<br><br><br>where:<br>U<br>(<br>h<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(h)}<br><br> = speed of the wind at height <br><br><br><br>h<br><br><br>{\displaystyle h}<br><br>, and <br><br><br><br>U<br>(<br>0<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle U(0)}<br><br> is a constant<br><br><br><br><br>ζ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \zeta }<br><br> = exponential coefficient based on ground surface roughness, typically between 0.08 and 0.52<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>d<br>U<br><br><br>d<br>h<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\frac {dU}{dh}}}<br><br> = expected wind gradient at height <br><br><br><br>h<br><br><br>{\displaystyle h}<br>In the 1862 American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.<br>Scientists have understood the effect of wind gradient upon refraction of sound since the mid-1900s; however, with the advent of the U.S. Noise Control Act, this refractive phenomenon was widely used beginning in the early 1970s, chiefly in the consideration of noise propagation from highways and resultant design of transportation facilities.<br><br>Further information: Sound<br>Wind gradient soaring[edit]<br>This albatross is an expert in dynamic soaring using the wind gradient.<br>Wind gradient soaring, also called dynamic soaring, is a technique used by soaring birds including albatrosses.
