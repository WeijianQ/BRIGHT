# Query `64`

## Original Question

*I got caught in a downpour while climbing a mountain and was amazed to see, as I climbed down, the tiny trickles of water combine to form mini-streams, the dry rocks I had climbed up now hosted sizable waterfalls, and the path which I had followed to the mountain had become a small river.

But it got me wondering about my question, which is the reverse of this. Why, after a long period of dry weather, are many rivers still flowing? I live near a river and it seems that it takes over a week of dry weather before there's any noticeable drop in its level. How does it not simply run out of water? Is it simply that it takes very a long time for the water at its source and the sources of all its tributaries to reach the point I'm observing from?

It seems there's a constant supply of water when I would have expected the network of rivers to start draining, and the drying up starting from the source the moment the rain stopped.*

The essential problem you're inquiring about is why rivers continue to flow and maintain their levels for a considerable period, even after a long stretch of dry weather. This phenomenon, which seems counterintuitive at first glance, can be explained by understanding the various sources of water for rivers and the mechanisms through which rivers are fed. Let's break down the factors and processes that contribute to this sustained flow of water in rivers:

1. **Groundwater Seepage**: One of the primary reasons rivers continue to flow during dry periods is the contribution of groundwater. Groundwater is water that fills the cracks and spaces in underground soil and rock layers. This water seeps into rivers at various points along their course, acting as a continuous source of water. The process of groundwater feeding into rivers is relatively slow, which helps maintain the flow of rivers even when there is no rainfall. The level of groundwater can take a long time to decrease, as it is replenished by rainwater percolating down through the soil and rock layers over weeks, months, or even years.

2. **Catchment Area and Size**: The catchment area of a river (the area from which a river collects runoff and precipitation) plays a significant role in its flow. Large rivers have extensive catchment areas that can span multiple regions with different weather patterns. While it might be dry in one area, another part of the catchment area could be experiencing rainfall, contributing to the river's flow. This spatial distribution of precipitation ensures that rivers receive a continuous supply of water from various sources.

3. **Snowmelt**: For rivers originating from mountainous regions, snowmelt is a significant source of water. During warmer months, the melting snow from mountains provides a consistent supply of water to rivers. This source is especially important in regions where seasonal snow accumulates over the winter months and gradually melts, contributing to the river flow throughout spring and summer.

4. **Natural and Artificial Reservoirs**: Lakes, wetlands, and artificial reservoirs also contribute to the sustained flow of rivers. These bodies of water release water into rivers over time, helping to maintain their levels during dry periods. The management of water release from dams and reservoirs can be crucial in ensuring a steady flow in rivers, especially for those heavily regulated by human activity.

5. **Vegetation and Soil Moisture**: The landscape surrounding a river, including its vegetation and soil moisture levels, can influence the river's flow. During periods of rain, soil and vegetation absorb and store water, which can then gradually feed into the river system. This delayed release of water from the landscape into the river helps sustain its flow during dry spells.

In summary, the apparent constancy of river flow, even during dry periods, is the result of a complex interplay between groundwater seepage, the expansive and varied catchment areas, contributions from snowmelt, the presence of natural and artificial reservoirs, and the buffering effect of the surrounding landscape. These factors combine to ensure that rivers do not "run out" of water immediately after the rain stops, but instead maintain their flow over extended periods of dry weather.

The karst zone is at the northwesternmost section, described in early topographical research as a plateau between Italy and Slovenia. Languages preserving this form include Italian: Carso, German: Karst, and Albanian: karsti.<br>In the local South Slavic languages, all variations of the word are derived from a Romanized Illyrian base (yielding Latin: carsus, Dalmatian: carsus), later metathesized from the reconstructed form korsъ into forms such as Slovene: kras[8] and Serbo-Croatian: krš, kras,[9][10][11][12] first attested in the 18th century, and the adjective form kraški in the 16th century.[13] As a proper noun, the Slovene form Grast was first attested in 1177.[14]<br>Ultimately, the word is of Mediterranean origin. It has also been suggested that the word may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root karra- 'rock'.[15] The name may also be connected to the oronym Kar(u)sádios oros cited by Ptolemy, and perhaps also to Latin Carusardius.[13][14]<br><br>Early studies[edit]<br>Doline in the causse de Sauveterre, Lozère, France<br>Johann Weikhard von Valvasor, a pioneer of the study of karst in Slovenia and a fellow of the Royal Society, London, introduced the word karst to European scholars in 1689 to describe the phenomenon of underground flows of rivers in his account of Lake Cerknica.[16]<br>Jovan Cvijić greatly advanced the knowledge of karst regions to the point where he became known as the "father of karst geomorphology". Primarily discussing the karstic regions of the Balkans, Cvijić's 1893 publication Das Karstphänomen describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes.[5] In a 1918 publication, Cvijić proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development.[5][17]<br>Karst hydrology emerged as a discipline in the late 1950s and the early 1960s in France. Previously, the activities of cave explorers, called speleologists, had been dismissed as more of a sport than a science and so the underground karstic caves and their associated watercourses were, from a scientific perspective, understudied.[18]<br><br>Development[edit]<br>A limestone deposit in the Dinaric Alps near Sinj, Croatia<br>Karst is most strongly developed in dense carbonate rock, such as limestone, that is thinly bedded and highly fractured. Karst is not typically well developed in chalk, because chalk is highly porous rather than dense, so the flow of groundwater is not concentrated along fractures. Karst is also most strongly developed where the water table is relatively low, such as in uplands with entrenched valleys, and where rainfall is moderate to heavy. This contributes to rapid downward movement of groundwater, which promotes dissolution of the bedrock, whereas standing groundwater becomes saturated with carbonate minerals and ceases to dissolve the bedrock.[19][20]<br><br>Chemistry of dissolution[edit]<br>The carbonic acid that causes karstic features is formed as rain passes through Earth's atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), which readily dissolves in the water. Once the rain reaches the ground, it may pass through soil that provides additional CO2 produced by soil respiration. Some of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form a weak carbonic acid solution, which dissolves calcium carbonate.[21] The primary reaction sequence in limestone dissolution is the following:[22]<br><br>Kostivere karst area in Estonia<br><br><br>H2O<br>+<br>CO2<br>→<br>H2CO3<br><br><br>CaCO3<br>+<br>H2CO3<br>→<br>Ca2+<br>+<br>2 HCO−3<br>In very rare conditions, oxidation can play a role.

As oxygen (O2)-rich surface waters seep into deep anoxic karst systems, they bring oxygen, which reacts with sulfide present in the system (pyrite or hydrogen sulfide) to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfuric acid then reacts with calcium carbonate, causing increased erosion within the limestone formation.

On exposed surfaces, small features may include solution flutes (or rillenkarren), runnels, limestone pavement (clints and grikes), kamenitzas collectively called karren or lapiez. Medium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs.<br>Large-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys. Mature karst landscapes, where more bedrock has been removed than remains, may result in karst towers, or haystack/eggbox landscapes. Beneath the surface, complex underground drainage systems (such as karst aquifers) and extensive caves and cavern systems may form.[19]<br>Erosion along limestone shores, notably in the tropics, produces karst topography that includes a sharp makatea surface above the normal reach of the sea, and undercuts that are mostly the result of biological activity or bioerosion at or a little above mean sea level.[26] Some of the most dramatic of these formations can be seen in Thailand's Phangnga Bay and at Halong Bay in Vietnam.<br>Calcium carbonate dissolved into water may precipitate out where the water discharges some of its dissolved carbon dioxide.

> part8 -------------------<br>Drive mechanisms[edit]<br>A virgin reservoir may be under sufficient pressure to push hydrocarbons to the surface. As the fluids are produced, the pressure will often decline, and production will falter. The reservoir may respond to the withdrawal of fluid in a way that tends to maintain the pressure. Artificial drive methods may be necessary.<br>Solution-gas drive[edit]<br>This mechanism (also known as depletion drive) depends on the associated gas of the oil. The virgin reservoir may be entirely semi-liquid but will be expected to have gaseous hydrocarbons in solution due to the pressure. As the reservoir depletes, the pressure falls below the bubble point, and the gas comes out of solution to form a gas cap at the top. This gas cap pushes down on the liquid helping to maintain pressure.<br>This occurs when the natural gas is in a cap below the oil. When the well is drilled the lowered pressure above means that the oil expands. As the pressure is reduced it reaches bubble point, and subsequently the gas bubbles drive the oil to the surface. The bubbles then reach critical saturation and flow together as a single gas phase. Beyond this point and below this pressure, the gas phase flows out more rapidly than the oil because of its lowered viscosity. More free gas is produced, and eventually the energy source is depleted. In some cases depending on the geology the gas may migrate to the top of the oil and form a secondary gas cap. Some energy may be supplied by water, gas in water, or compressed rock. These are usually minor contributions with respect to hydrocarbon expansion.<br>By properly managing the production rates, greater benefits can be had from solution-gas drives. Secondary recovery involves the injection of gas or water to maintain reservoir pressure. The gas/oil ratio and the oil production rate are stable until the reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point when critical gas saturation is reached. When the gas is exhausted, the gas/oil ratio and the oil rate drops, the reservoir pressure has been reduced, and the reservoir energy is exhausted.<br>Gas cap drive[edit]<br>In reservoirs already having a gas cap (the virgin pressure is already below bubble point), the gas cap expands with the depletion of the reservoir, pushing down on the liquid sections applying extra pressure. This is present in the reservoir if there is more gas than can be dissolved in the reservoir. The gas will often migrate to the crest of the structure. It is compressed on top of the oil reserve, as the oil is produced the cap helps to push the oil out. Over time the gas cap moves down and infiltrates the oil, and the well will produce more and more gas until it produces only gas.<br>It is best to manage the gas cap effectively, that is, placing the oil wells such that the gas cap will not reach them until the maximum amount of oil is produced. Also a high production rate may cause the gas to migrate downward into the production interval. In this case, over time the reservoir pressure depletion is not as steep as in the case of solution-based gas drive. In this case, the oil rate will not decline as steeply but will depend also on the placement of the well with respect to the gas cap. As with other drive mechanisms, water or gas injection can be used to maintain reservoir pressure. When a gas cap is coupled with water influx, the recovery mechanism can be highly efficient.<br>Aquifer (water) drive[edit]<br>Water (usually salty) may be present below the hydrocarbons. Water, as with all liquids, is compressible to a small degree. As the hydrocarbons are depleted, the reduction in pressure in the reservoir allows the water to expand slightly. Although this unit expansion is minute, if the aquifer is large enough this will translate into a large increase in volume, which will push up on the hydrocarbons, maintaining pressure.<br>With a water-drive reservoir, the decline in reservoir pressure is very slight; in some cases, the reservoir pressure may remain unchanged. The gas/oil ratio also remains stable. The oil rate will remain fairly stable until the water reaches the well. In time, the water cut will increase, and the well will be watered out.<br>The water may be present in an aquifer (but rarely one replenished with surface water). This water gradually replaces the volume of oil and gas that is produced out of the well, given that the production rate is equivalent to the aquifer activity. That is, the aquifer is being replenished from some natural water influx. If the water begins to be produced along with the oil, the recovery rate may become uneconomical owing to the higher lifting and water disposal costs.<br>Water and gas injection[edit]<br><br>Main article: Water injection (oil production)<br>If the natural drives are insufficient, as they very often are, then the pressure can be artificially maintained by injecting water into the aquifer or gas into the gas cap.<br>Gravity drainage[edit]<br>The force of gravity will cause the oil to move downward of the gas and upward of the water. If vertical permeability exists then recovery rates may be even better.<br>Gas and gas condensate reservoirs[edit]<br>These occur if the reservoir conditions allow the hydrocarbons to exist as a gas. Retrieval is a matter of gas expansion. Recovery from a closed reservoir (i.e., no water drive) is very good, especially if bottom hole pressure is reduced to a minimum (usually done with compressors at the wellhead). Any produced liquids are light-colored to colorless, with a gravity higher than 45 API. Gas cycling is the process where dry gas is injected and produced along with condensed liquid.

> <listreams gain water from inflow of groundwater through the streambed (gaining stream),</li<br><listreams lose water to groundwater by outflow through the streambed (losing stream), or</li<br><lithey do both, gaining in some reaches and losing in other reaches.</li<br></ul<br><pFor groundwater to discharge into a stream channel, the altitude of the water table in the vicinity of the stream must be higher than the altitude of the stream-water surface. Conversely, for surface water to seep to groundwater, the altitude of the water table in the vicinity of the stream must be lower than the altitude of the stream-water surface. Surface-water depletion is directly associated with chronic lowering of groundwater levels.&nbsp;The amount of water that is gained by a stream from groundwater is called <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/base-flow-rivers"baseflow</a</strong.</p<br><pThe movement of water between groundwater and surface water provides a major pathway for chemical transfer between the ground and stream. As chemicals are transferred between groundwater and surface water, the supply of carbon, oxygen, nutrients such as <a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/nitrogen-and-water"<strongnitrogen</strong </aand <a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/phosphorus-and-water"<strongphosphorus</strong</a, and other chemicals that have effects on eco-biological processes on both sides of the interface can be affected. This transfer can&nbsp;affect the biological and chemical characteristics of the stream and ecosystems&nbsp;downstream.</p<br><p<strongLooking at the diagram...</strong</p<br><pThis diagram is a very general schematic of how groundwater contributes water into surface water (<strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/rivers-streams-and-creeks"streams, rivers, and lakes</a</strong). In this case, this is a "gaining stream", which generally gains water from the ground. Other streams are "losing streams", which lose water from the streambed out into the ground. Rivers can be gaining and losing at different locations; they can be gaining one time of the year and losing in another time of year. And, as the yellow arrow shows, even a gaining stream will be losing some water, and the other way around. In this diagram, though, we're showing a gaining stream where groundwater is entering the streambed.</p<br><figure role="group" class="align-right side-image"<br><br>  <div class="d-media embedded-media d-media--type--image media--view-mode--side-image"<br>          <a href="/media/images/a-gaining-stream-has-water-seeping-it-ground"<br>            <br><div class="field field--name--image field--type--image field--label--hidden"<br>    <br>      <div class="image"  <img loading="lazy" src="https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/side_image/public/thumbnails/image/wss-gw-sw-streams-contain-groundwater.gif?itok=IPjqx5rH" width="340" height="199" alt="Diagram showing how sometimes water seeps into rivers from the surrounding ground" typeof="foaf:Image"<br><br><br></div<br>  <br></div<br><br>          </a<br>              <div class="d-media-copyright"<br>        Sources/Usage: Public Domain. <a href="/media/images/a-gaining-stream-has-water-seeping-it-ground"View Media Details</a<br>      </div<br>          </div<br><br><figcaptionStreams Can Contain Groundwater</figcaption<br></figure<br><pOf course, the source of all water is <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/precipitation-and-water-cycle"precipitation</a</strong, the downward arrows coming down from the top in the diagram.

This zone is the area that plants put down roots in, and thus draw water from. The green arrow shows that water moves up from the unsaturated zone into the plants and then out of the plants as <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/evapotranspiration-and-water-cycle"evapotranspiration</a</strong.</p<br><pA lot of <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/infiltration-and-water-cycle"water will keep moving downward</a</strong into the ground to fill the <a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/aquifers-and-groundwater"<strongaquifer</strong</a, in which all of the open pores and spaces are full of water (from which people can drill wells into and get water out). The top point of this saturated zone is the water table. All of the blue arrows underground show how, in this situation, some water moves towards the stream, since the bottom of the streambed is lower than the water table, and thus intersects the aquifer. In this way, even if no rain has fallen in a while, water is still entering the streambed, even if you can't see it happening. And, you can't see the smiles on the faces of the fish in the river who don't have to worry (too much) about their living space drying up during periods of no rainfall.</p<br></div</div<br>  <br></div<br><br>      </div<br></div<br>  <br></div<br><br>        <br>    <br>  </div<br><br>  <br></div<br><br>        </div<br>                        <div class="usgs-tabs-content tab ui-tabs-panel ui-corner-bottom ui-widget-content" id="science" aria-labelledby="ui-id-2" role="tabpanel" aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;"<br>            <div class="paragraph paragraph--type--related-science-tab paragraph--view-mode--tab-content"<br>          <br><div class="intro-cta"<br>      <br><div class="field field--name--field-intro field--type--text-long field--label--hidden"<br>    <br>      <div class="field-intro"<pBelow are other science topics associated with rivers and groundwater.</p</div<br>  <br></div<br><br>  </div<br>  <div class="highlighted-related-item"<br>    <div class="science-desktop"<br><div about="/special-topics/water-science-school/science/groundwater-information-topic" class="node node--type--science node--view-mode--list grid-row grid-gap-3"<br>      <div class="grid-col-2 image"<br>              <a href="/special-topics/water-science-school/science/groundwater-information-topic"<br>          <span class="usa-sr-only usgs-screenreader-only"link</span<br>              <br><div class="field field--name--field-thumbnail field--type--entity-reference field--label--hidden"<br>    <br>      <div class="field-thumbnail"  <img loading="lazy" src="https://d9-wret.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/palladium/production/s3fs-public/styles/list_item/public/thumbnails/image/groundwater_banner.png?itok=iliyXxBX" width="180" height="180" alt="Groundwater Information by Topic" typeof="foaf:Image"<br><br><br></div<br>  <br></div<br><br>              </a<br>          </div<br>    <div class="grid-col-10 info"<br>      <time datetime="2018-10-09T10:30:00Z"October 9, 2018</time<br><br><br>    <h4<br>              <a href="/special-topics/water-science-school/science/groundwater-information-topic"<br>                Groundwater Information by Topic<br><br>              </a<br>          </h4<br>    <br><div class="field field--name--field-intro field--type--text-long field--label--hidden"<br>    <br>      <div class="field-intro"  Groundwater is one of our most valuable resources—even though you probably never see it or even realize it is there.

The water flowing in rivers still originates from precipitation, but it is not all from surface runoff. This <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-flows-underground"groundwater seepage</a</strong is vitally important to the hydrologic settings of the world because it is responsible for keeping water in rivers during times of no rainfall (base flow conditions).</p<br><pGroundwater contributes to streamflow in most physiographic and climatic settings in the world. Many things, such as a region's geography, geology, soil type and saturation, and climate, determine the proportion of stream water that comes from groundwater. <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/what-hydrology"Hydrologists</a</strong (water scientists) can determine the amount of water that groundwater contributes to streams by analyzing streamflow hydrographs and precipitation records. From these studies, hydrologists can determine how much of a stream's flow comes from <strong<a href="/special-topic/water-science-school/science/surface-runoff-and-water-cycle"runoff</a</strong and how much comes from groundwater discharging into the streambed.</p<br><p&nbsp;</p<br><h3Streams interact with groundwater in all types of landscapes</h3<br><pThe interaction takes place in three basic ways:</p<br><ul
