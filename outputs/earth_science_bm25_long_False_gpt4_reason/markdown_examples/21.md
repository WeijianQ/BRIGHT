The essential problem here is determining the deepest point humans have reached within the Earth's crust, whether through direct physical presence (e.g., by foot or submarine) or indirectly via tools like drills or cameras. This exploration can be divided into two main categories: terrestrial (beneath the Earth's surface) and marine (below sea level).

1. **Terrestrial Depth Exploration:**

The Kola Superdeep Borehole in Russia represents one of humanity's deepest penetrations into the Earth's crust. It's not a place someone can travel by foot or with a camera in the traditional sense, as it's essentially a very deep hole drilled for scientific research. The project reached its maximum depth in 1989, achieving a depth of about 12,262 meters (or approximately 40,230 feet). This makes it one of the deepest artificial points on Earth. However, it's important to note that this is a borehole, so it's not a space that humans or even cameras can traverse in a conventional manner.

2. **Marine Depth Exploration:**

When considering exploration below sea level, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is the deepest known point in the Earth's seabed. It has been reached by manned submersibles as well as unmanned vehicles. The deepest dive recorded was by the Deepsea Challenger, piloted by James Cameron in 2012, reaching a depth of nearly 10,908 meters (or about 35,787 feet). Additionally, in 2019, the DSV Limiting Factor, a two-person submersible, completed a dive to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, piloted by Victor Vescovo. This area represents the deepest point in the ocean that humans have reached.

3. **Comparative Analysis:**

When comparing these achievements, the Kola Superdeep Borehole represents the deepest point beneath the Earth's surface that we have reached through drilling. However, this was not an exploration that could be physically entered or traversed by humans. In contrast, the Challenger Deep represents the deepest point below sea level that humans have physically reached using submersible technology.

In summary, the deepest we have gone into the Earth's crust is through the Kola Superdeep Borehole via drilling, while the deepest point below sea level where humans have traveled is the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench via submersible. Both represent incredible feats of human curiosity and engineering, pushing the boundaries of what we know about our planet.

Harmony Gold also acquired Mine Waste Solutions as they gathered the remainder of AGA's assets in late 2020. As of 2022, all-in costs of production were US$1771/oz (US$1614/Troy oz). Even at near record high gold prices, Mponeng is barely breaking even. Gold is currently worth roughly US$2080/oz (US$1900/Troy oz). Over 5400 metric tons of rock are excavated from Mponeng each day.<br>The most recent publication from Harmony Gold outlines their 2023 year production:<br>Produced: 7449kg (239 490 oz) of gold<br>Grade: 8.43g/t<br>Volume of ore milled: 884 000 tons<br>History[edit]<br>Being a part of the Witwatersrand, the largest gold deposit on earth, Mponeng is the result of the discovery of the basin.  Beginning in the 1850-70s a series of discoveries were made, Pieter Jacob panning gold from a river and a Henry Lewis finding quartz and gold vein on a farm.   Mponeng officially began mining operations in 1986, near Carletonville.Before Mponeng, the mine was known as the Western Deep Levels South Shaft or the No1 Shaft, he name Mponeng came to be in 1999.

> part5 -------------------<br>Seismicity[edit]<br>Seismicity in mines is common as removing mass amounts of rock can change stress dynamics, especially if pre-existing faults exist. This seismicity is termed 'mining-induced seismicity' are still the release of elastic strain but are often low moment magnitude.  Reaching beyond 1000 events a day, events of any size pose serious risk to mining operations and employees. It is not uncommon for equipment to be damaged, or have the collapse of drifts and stopes as a result of events.<br>On December 27, 2007 a dyke within Mponeng experienced a 1.9 magnitude event.  Caused by stress change due to excavation within the mine. In March of 2020 Mponeng experienced a magnitude 2 event, 3 were killed.In deep mines vertical stress can reach an astounding 80-100 MPa, equivalent to roughly 10km under water.  Seismicity in deep gold mines is common, and is often induced by mining activities.   2 events can be considered:<br>Type A - low moment magnitude (<1), clustered in time and space, within 100m of mining surface.<br>Induced by blasting, perturbation of excavating processes, closure of stopes.<br>Type B - possible higher moment magnitude (3), not clustered in time or space.<br>associated with friction dominated existing shear, tectonic earthquakes.<br>Most earthquakes at depth are mining related (Type A), typically associated with the beginning of a new stope.<br>Research[edit]<br>One way to move forward is a better understanding of rock burst and excavation methods. A better understanding can provide better safety protocols.  A prominent use of deep mines and their associated, often low magnitude, earthquakes is to connect laboratory scale experiments to real world situations.  There is also considerable research trying to understand nucleation of said earthquakes, and whether they work the same as larger earthquakes.  In Mponeng, JAGUARS (Japanese-German Acoustic Emissions Research in South Africa) has emplaced a network of accelerometers and piezoelectric acoustic emissions sensors. These sensors can record very small moment magnitude earthquakes, capable of recording events with frequencies from 0.7 kHz to 200 kHz (M<0.5).  In a one year period, 2007-2008,  nearly 500,000 events were recorded, most of which with low (sub 25 kHz) frequencies. The JAGUARS network in placed below the Ventersdorp Contact Reef, there are 8 Acoustic Emissions sensor, 2 strainmeters, and one triaxial accelerometer that make up the network.

> part4 -------------------<br>Geology and gold bearing fractures[edit]<br>The mine sits in the Witwatersrand Basin and utilizes 2 horizons; Ventersdorp Contact Reef and Carbon Leader Reef. In the Mponeng mine the Ventersdorp Contact Reef is mainly interbedded quartzite and coarse conglomerates and constitutes only a meter or two of thickness. The Witwatersrand Basin has experienced many surges of thrusting, resulting in abundant fractures.  These small faults often correspond to depositional and sediment contacts.  This complicated geologic history associates with gold mineralization to a high degree, the Witwatersrand Basin holds nearly a third of gold reserves and is responsible for over 40% of all gold.<br>The gold mineralization is likely related to hydrothermal activity, and occurs in varying lithology of conglomerates, known as the reefs stated above. Thicknesses ranging from around 10cm to a 1-meter,  gold is found in pebble lags, stacked fluvial deposits, and other stratigraphy.  Mponeng specifically,  gold is associated with previously mentioned thrust fracturing and with the following mineralization's:<br>Steep quartz/sulphide-bearing fractures<br>Sub-horizontal quartz fractures<br>Sulphide-bearing fractures<br>Ultracataclastics<br>Mesophased hydrocarbons.

A mixture of concrete, water, and rock is packed into excavated areas, which further acts as an insulator. Tunnel walls are secured by flexible shotcrete reinforced with steel fibers, which is further held in place by diamond-mesh netting.<br>In 2008, researchers looking for extremophile organisms discovered the bacterium Desulforudis audaxviator present within groundwater samples from kilometers deep in the mine. The name 'Audaxviator' comes from the popular novel "Journey to the Center of the Earth" (Jules Verne), which means 'descend, bold traveler, and attain the center of the Earth'.
