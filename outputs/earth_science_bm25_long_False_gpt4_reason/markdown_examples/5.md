# Query `5`

## Original Question

*As far as I understand it is perfectly valid for air to have 100% humidity. At that point, all water can still exist in form of vapor, non-condensed.Does it immediately start to rain if humidity is >100%?If so, why do we have slight rain and heavy rain if any 0.1% above 100% drops out immediately? That should always be only a small amount of rain and rainstorms could not be explained.If not, what is the limit of humidity if not 100% and why can it exceed 100%?*

The essential problem here involves understanding the concept of 100% humidity, what happens when humidity exceeds 100%, and how this relates to the occurrence of rain, including variations in rain intensity.

### Understanding Humidity

1. **What is 100% Humidity?** 
   - At 100% relative humidity, the air is saturated with water vapor and cannot hold any more moisture at that particular temperature and pressure. This doesn't mean it's raining; it simply means the air has reached its maximum capacity to hold water vapor.

### What Happens Above 100% Humidity?

2. **Exceeding 100% Humidity - Super-Saturation:**
   - It is possible for air to exceed 100% relative humidity, a condition known as supersaturation. This can occur under certain conditions, such as when air is cooled very rapidly or when there are no particles in the air to facilitate condensation (water needs a surface to condense upon, such as dust or other aerosols in the atmosphere).

### The Role of Condensation Nuclei

3. **Condensation Nuclei:**
   - For rain to form, water vapor needs something to condense upon. These are called condensation nuclei and can be particles like dust, smoke, or sea salt. Without these, even supersaturated air might not immediately result in condensation or precipitation.

### Why Rainfall Intensity Varies

4. **Formation of Raindrops:**
   - Raindrops form through the coalescence of water droplets around condensation nuclei. This process can take time, and the amount of moisture available, the presence and concentration of condensation nuclei, and atmospheric conditions will affect whether you get light rain or a heavy downpour.

5. **Rain Intensity:**
   - Light rain vs. heavy rain isn't just about how much the humidity exceeds 100%. It's also about the volume of air involved, the duration of supersaturation, the temperature, the presence of updrafts in clouds that allow droplets to combine into larger droplets, and the overall dynamics of the weather system.

### Beyond 100% Humidity

6. **Supersaturation and Rain Formation:**
   - Rain does not start immediately once humidity exceeds 100%. The process depends on having sufficient condensation nuclei and the right conditions for droplets to form and grow large enough to fall as precipitation. The atmosphere can support supersaturation to a degree, but eventually, the excess moisture will condense and precipitate out, especially as air masses move and interact.

7. **Limit of Humidity:**
   - While there's no fixed "limit" to humidity in practical terms, supersaturation is typically a transient state in the atmosphere. The specific limit to how much it can exceed 100% without rain forming depends on conditions like temperature, availability of condensation nuclei, and atmospheric dynamics.

In summary, the process of rain formation is more complex than simply exceeding 100% humidity. The variability in rain intensity is due to a combination of factors including the amount of moisture in the air, the availability of condensation nuclei, atmospheric conditions, and the dynamics within clouds. Supersaturation is possible but generally temporary, leading to precipitation under the right conditions.

Hence small particles (like small droplets) are more soluble than larger ones.

For example, if a container filled with water vapour at slightly below the saturation pressure is suddenly cooled, perhaps by adiabatic expansion, as in a cloud chamber, the vapour may become supersaturated with respect to liquid water. It is then in a metastable state, and we may expect condensation to take place. A reasonable molecular model of condensation would seem to be that two or three molecules of water vapour come together to form a tiny droplet, and that this nucleus of condensation then grows by accretion, as additional vapour molecules happen to hit it. The Kelvin equation, however, indicates that a tiny droplet like this nucleus, being only a few ångströms in diameter, would have a vapour pressure many times that of the bulk liquid. As far as tiny nuclei are concerned, the vapour would not be supersaturated at all. Such nuclei should immediately re-evaporate, and the emergence of a new phase at the equilibrium pressure, or even moderately above it should be impossible. Hence, the over-saturation must be several times higher than the normal saturation value for spontaneous nucleation to occur.<br>There are two ways of resolving this paradox. In the first place, we know the statistical basis of the second law of thermodynamics. In any system at equilibrium, there are always fluctuations around the equilibrium condition, and if the system contains few molecules, these fluctuations may be relatively large. There is always a chance that an appropriate fluctuation may lead to the formation of a nucleus of a new phase, even though the tiny nucleus could be called thermodynamically unstable. The chance of a fluctuation is e, where ΔS is the deviation of the entropy from the equilibrium value.<br>It is unlikely, however, that new phases often arise by this fluctuation mechanism and the resultant spontaneous nucleation. Calculations show that the chance,  e, is usually too small. It is more likely that tiny dust particles act as nuclei in supersaturated vapours or solutions. In the cloud chamber, it is the clusters of ions caused by a passing high-energy particle that acts as nucleation centers. Actually, vapours seem to be much less finicky than solutions about the sort of nuclei required. This is because a liquid will condense on almost any surface, but crystallization requires the presence of crystal faces of the proper kind.<br>For a sessile drop residing on a solid surface, the Kelvin equation is modified near the contact line, due to intermolecular interactions between the liquid drop and the solid surface.

The vapor pressure at a convex curved surface is higher than that at a flat surface. The Kelvin equation is dependent upon thermodynamic principles and does not allude to special properties of materials. It is also used for determination of pore size distribution of a porous medium using adsorption porosimetry.  The equation is named in honor of William Thomson, also known as Lord Kelvin.

The equation would then be given by:<br>ln<br>⁡<br><br><br>c<br><br>c<br><br><br>s<br>a<br>t<br><br><br><br><br><br>=<br><br><br><br>2<br>γ<br><br>V<br><br>m<br><br><br><br><br>r<br>R<br>T<br><br><br><br>.<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \ln {\frac {c}{c_{\rm {sat}}}}={\frac {2\gamma V_{\text{m}}}{rRT}}.}<br>These results led to the problem of how new phases can ever arise from old ones. For example, if a container filled with water vapour at slightly below the saturation pressure is suddenly cooled, perhaps by adiabatic expansion, as in a cloud chamber, the vapour may become supersaturated with respect to liquid water. It is then in a metastable state, and we may expect condensation to take place. A reasonable molecular model of condensation would seem to be that two or three molecules of water vapour come together to form a tiny droplet, and that this nucleus of condensation then grows by accretion, as additional vapour molecules happen to hit it. The Kelvin equation, however, indicates that a tiny droplet like this nucleus, being only a few ångströms in diameter, would have a vapour pressure many times that of the bulk liquid. As far as tiny nuclei are concerned, the vapour would not be supersaturated at all. Such nuclei should immediately re-evaporate, and the emergence of a new phase at the equilibrium pressure, or even moderately above it should be impossible. Hence, the over-saturation must be several times higher than the normal saturation value for spontaneous nucleation to occur.<br>There are two ways of resolving this paradox. In the first place, we know the statistical basis of the second law of thermodynamics. In any system at equilibrium, there are always fluctuations around the equilibrium condition, and if the system contains few molecules, these fluctuations may be relatively large. There is always a chance that an appropriate fluctuation may lead to the formation of a nucleus of a new phase, even though the tiny nucleus could be called thermodynamically unstable. The chance of a fluctuation is e, where ΔS is the deviation of the entropy from the equilibrium value.<br>It is unlikely, however, that new phases often arise by this fluctuation mechanism and the resultant spontaneous nucleation. Calculations show that the chance,  e, is usually too small. It is more likely that tiny dust particles act as nuclei in supersaturated vapours or solutions. In the cloud chamber, it is the clusters of ions caused by a passing high-energy particle that acts as nucleation centers. Actually, vapours seem to be much less finicky than solutions about the sort of nuclei required. This is because a liquid will condense on almost any surface, but crystallization requires the presence of crystal faces of the proper kind.<br>For a sessile drop residing on a solid surface, the Kelvin equation is modified near the contact line, due to intermolecular interactions between the liquid drop and the solid surface.  This extended Kelvin equation is given by<br>ln<br>⁡<br><br><br>c<br><br>c<br><br><br>s<br>a<br>t<br><br><br><br><br><br>=<br><br><br><br>V<br><br>m<br><br><br><br>R<br>T<br><br><br><br><br>(<br><br><br><br><br>2<br>γ<br><br>r<br><br><br>+<br>Π<br><br>)<br><br>.<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \ln {\frac {c}{c_{\rm {sat}}}}={\frac {V_{\text{m}}}{RT}}\left({\frac {2\gamma }{r}}+\Pi \right).}<br>where <br><br><br><br>Π<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \Pi }<br><br> is the disjoining pressure that accounts for the intermolecular interactions between the sessile drop and the solid and <br><br><br><br><br>(<br><br>2<br>γ<br><br>/<br><br>r<br><br>)<br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle \left(2\gamma /r\right)}<br><br> is the Laplace pressure, accounting for the curvature-induced pressure inside the liquid drop. When the interactions are attractive in nature, the disjoining pressure, <br><br><br><br>Π<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \Pi }<br><br> is negative. Near the contact line, the disjoining pressure dominates over the Laplace pressure, implying that the solubility, <br><br><br><br>c<br><br><br>{\displaystyle c}<br><br> is less than <br><br><br><br><br>c<br><br><br>s<br>a<br>t<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle c_{\rm {sat}}}<br><br>. This implies that a new phase can spontaneously grow on a solid surface, even under saturation conditions.

> part3 -------------------<br>Significance to thunderstorms[edit]<br>Thunderstorms form when air parcels are lifted vertically.  Deep, moist convection requires a parcel to be lifted to the LFC where it then rises spontaneously until reaching a layer of non-positive buoyancy.  The atmosphere is warm at the surface and lower levels of the troposphere where there is mixing (the planetary boundary layer (PBL)), but becomes substantially cooler with height.  The temperature profile of the atmosphere, the change in temperature, the degree that it cools with height, is the lapse rate.  When the rising air parcel cools more slowly than the surrounding atmosphere, it remains warmer and less dense.  The parcel continues to rise freely (convectively; without mechanical lift) through the atmosphere until it reaches an area of air less dense (warmer) than itself.<br>The amount, and shape, of the positive-buoyancy area modulates the speed of updrafts, thus extreme CAPE can result in explosive thunderstorm development; such rapid development usually occurs when CAPE stored by a capping inversion is released when the "lid" is broken by heating or mechanical lift.  The amount of CAPE also modulates how low-level vorticity is entrained and then stretched in the updraft, with importance to tornadogenesis.  The most important CAPE for tornadoes is within the lowest 1 to 3 km (0.6 to 1.9 mi) of the atmosphere, whilst deep layer CAPE and the width of CAPE at mid-levels is important for supercells.  Tornado outbreaks tend to occur within high CAPE environments.  Large CAPE is required for the production of very large hail, owing to updraft strength, although a rotating updraft may be stronger with less CAPE.  Large CAPE also promotes lightning activity.<br>Two notable days for severe weather exhibited CAPE values over 5 kJ/kg.  Two hours before the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak occurred on May 3, 1999, the CAPE value sounding at Oklahoma City was at 5.89 kJ/kg.  A few hours later, an F5 tornado ripped through the southern suburbs of the city.  Also on May 4, 2007 CAPE values of 5.5 kJ/kg were reached and an EF5 tornado tore through Greensburg, Kansas.  On these days, it was apparent that conditions were ripe for tornadoes and CAPE wasn't a crucial factor.  However, extreme CAPE, by modulating the updraft (and downdraft), can allow for exceptional events, such as the deadly F5 tornadoes that hit Plainfield, Illinois on August 28, 1990 and Jarrell, Texas on May 27, 1997 on days which weren't readily apparent as conducive to large tornadoes.  CAPE was estimated to exceed 8 kJ/kg in the environment of the Plainfield storm and was around 7 kJ/kg for the Jarrell storm.<br>Severe weather and tornadoes can develop in an area of low CAPE values.  The surprise severe weather event that occurred in Illinois and Indiana on April 20, 2004 is a good example.  Importantly in that case, was that although overall CAPE was weak, there was strong CAPE in the lowest levels of the troposphere which enabled an outbreak of minisupercells producing large, long-track, intense tornadoes.

> part3 -------------------<br>History[edit]<br>The form of the Kelvin equation here is not the form in which it appeared in Lord Kelvin's article of 1871.  The derivation of the form that appears in this article from Kelvin's original equation was presented by Robert von Helmholtz (son of German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz) in his dissertation of 1885. In 2020, researchers found that the equation was accurate down to the 1nm scale.
