# Query `114`

## Original Question

*Generally speaking, iron is considered to be a very common resource. But I cannot find any evidence that there is any of it at all in New Guinea. Copper and gold, yes. Even nickel and cobalt. Iron on the nearby island of Bougainville. But no mention of iron.

Are there really no useful iron deposits on the entire island? Or is it more like, there are some, just not big enough to make the news?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is determining whether there are any iron deposits in New Guinea, given that there's a notable absence of public information or news about such deposits. This contrasts with the known presence of other minerals like copper, gold, nickel, and cobalt, and the existence of iron deposits on the nearby island of Bougainville. The question is whether this lack of information indicates a genuine absence of iron deposits or if it suggests that any existing deposits might not be significant enough to garner attention.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Geological Potential**: New Guinea, being part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, has a complex geological structure that hosts a variety of minerals. The presence of minerals like copper and gold suggests a geologically active area, which could also be conducive to the presence of iron ore deposits. However, the formation of iron deposits typically requires specific conditions that might not be as prevalent in New Guinea's geological environment.

2. **Exploration and Discovery**: The discovery of mineral deposits depends heavily on exploration efforts. If there has been limited exploration for iron in New Guinea, this could explain the lack of publicly known iron deposits. Exploration tends to focus on minerals with high economic value or demand, which may have historically directed attention away from iron in favor of copper, gold, and other minerals.

3. **Economic Viability**: Even if iron deposits exist in New Guinea, their economic viability would depend on factors like size, grade, and accessibility. It's possible that any iron deposits present are not economically viable to mine, either due to their quality or the cost of extraction and processing. This might deter investment in exploration specifically for iron, contributing to the lack of public information.

4. **Comparison with Other Regions**: The presence of iron on the nearby island of Bougainville indicates that the regional geology can support iron ore deposits. However, geological conditions can vary significantly even across short distances, and the economic and political context can also influence the development of mineral resources.

5. **Reporting and Interest**: The global market for iron is massive, but it's dominated by countries with vast, high-grade deposits. This could mean that smaller or lower-grade deposits in places like New Guinea don't make headlines or attract significant investment, especially if they can't compete on cost with larger producers.

### Conclusion

While the absence of publicly known iron deposits in New Guinea might suggest there are no significant deposits, it's also plausible that existing deposits have not been explored or reported extensively due to a focus on more economically valuable minerals, or because any deposits that do exist are not deemed economically viable to mine. The lack of information does not definitively prove the absence of iron ore in New Guinea, but rather indicates a gap in exploration, reporting, or economic interest. Further geological exploration specifically targeting iron could potentially reveal the presence of deposits that have not yet been identified or publicized.

> part5 -------------------<br>Occurrence<br>Origin<br>Along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron, uranium is only naturally formed by the r-process (rapid neutron capture) in supernovae and neutron star mergers. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process, because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, U and U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of U, which has a shorter half-life and so is an extinct radionuclide, having long since decayed completely to Th. Uranium-236 was itself enriched by the decay of Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct Pu (half-life 0.375 million years) and Cm (half-life 16 million years), producing U and U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than U and Pu, the parents of thorium: the Cm:U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0±1.6)×10.<br>Biotic and abiotic<br><br>Main article: Uranium in the environment<br>Uraninite, also known as pitchblende, is the most common ore mined to extract uranium.<br>The evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat flow over time: contribution from U in red and from U in green<br>Uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the Earth's outer core in the liquid state and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.<br>Uranium's average concentration in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25 km (15 mi) down is calculated to contain 10 kg (2×10 lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 10 kg (2×10 lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers), and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion.<br>Uranium is more plentiful than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).<br>Some bacteria, such as Shewanella putrefaciens, Geobacter metallireducens and some strains of Burkholderia fungorum, use uranium for their growth and convert U(VI) to U(IV). Recent research suggests that this pathway includes reduction of the soluble U(VI) via an intermediate U(V) pentavalent state.<br>Other organisms, such as the lichen Trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.<br>The proteobacterium Geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water. The mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant.<br>In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.<br>Plants absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.<br>Production and mining<br><br>Main article: Uranium mining<br>Worldwide production of uranium in 2021 amounted to 48,332 tonnes, of which 21,819 t (45%) was mined in Kazakhstan. Other important uranium mining countries are Namibia (5,753 t), Canada (4,693 t), Australia (4,192 t), Uzbekistan (3,500 t),  and Russia (2,635 t).<br>Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and borehole mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.<br>Commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals.

### DOC[5] (IRRELEVANT) limestone/Limestone2.txt
> part2 -------------------<br>Description<br>This limestone deposit in the karst of Dinaric Alps near Sinj, Croatia, was formed in the Eocene.<br>Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO3)2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium. Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium calcite, with the dividing line placed at a composition of 4% magnesium. High-magnesium calcite retains the calcite mineral structure, which is distinct from dolomite. Aragonite does not usually contain significant magnesium. Most limestone is otherwise chemically fairly pure, with clastic sediments (mainly fine-grained quartz and clay minerals) making up less than 5% to 10% of the composition. Organic matter typically makes up around 0.2% of a limestone and rarely exceeds 1%.<br>Limestone often contains variable amounts of silica in the form of chert or siliceous skeletal fragments (such as sponge spicules, diatoms, or radiolarians). Fossils are also common in limestone.<br>Limestone is commonly white to gray in color. Limestone that is unusually rich in organic matter can be almost black in color, while traces of iron or manganese can give limestone an off-white to yellow to red color. The density of limestone depends on its porosity, which varies from 0.1% for the densest limestone to 40% for chalk. The density correspondingly ranges from 1.5 to 2.7 g/cm. Although relatively soft, with a Mohs hardness of 2 to 4, dense limestone can have a crushing strength of up to 180 MPa. For comparison, concrete typically has a crushing strength of about 40 MPa.<br>Although limestones show little variability in mineral composition, they show great diversity in texture. However, most limestone consists of sand-sized grains in a carbonate mud matrix. Because limestones are often of biological origin and are usually composed of sediment that is deposited close to where it formed, classification of limestone is usually based on its grain type and mud content.<br>Grains<br>Ooids from a beach on Joulter's Cay, The Bahamas<br>Ooids in limestone of the Carmel Formation (Middle Jurassic) of southwestern Utah.<br>Thin-section view of a Middle Jurassic limestone in southern Utah, U.S. The round grains are ooids; the largest is 1.2 mm (0.05 in) in diameter. This limestone is an oosparite.<br>Most grains in limestone are skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral or foraminifera. These organisms secrete structures made of aragonite or calcite, and leave these structures behind when they die. Other carbonate grains composing limestones are ooids, peloids, and limeclasts (intraclasts and extraclasts [ca]).<br>Skeletal grains have a composition reflecting the organisms that produced them and the environment in which they were produced. Low-magnesium calcite skeletal grains are typical of articulate brachiopods, planktonic (free-floating) foraminifera, and coccoliths. High-magnesium calcite skeletal grains are typical of benthic (bottom-dwelling) foraminifera, echinoderms, and coralline algae. Aragonite skeletal grains are typical of molluscs, calcareous green algae, stromatoporoids, corals, and tube worms. The skeletal grains also reflect specific geological periods and environments. For example, coral grains are more common in high-energy environments (characterized by strong currents and turbulence) while bryozoan grains are more common in low-energy environments (characterized by quiet water).<br>Ooids (sometimes called ooliths) are sand-sized grains (less than 2mm in diameter) consisting of one or more layers of calcite or aragonite around a central quartz grain or carbonate mineral fragment. These likely form by direct precipitation of calcium carbonate onto the ooid. Pisoliths are similar to ooids, but they are larger than 2 mm in diameter and tend to be more irregular in shape. Limestone composed mostly of ooids is called an oolite or sometimes an oolitic limestone. Ooids form in high-energy environments, such as the Bahama platform, and oolites typically show crossbedding and other features associated with deposition in strong currents.<br>Oncoliths resemble ooids but show a radial rather than layered internal structure, indicating that they were formed by algae in a normal marine environment.<br>Peloids are structureless grains of microcrystalline carbonate likely produced by a variety of processes. Many are thought to be fecal pellets produced by marine organisms. Others may be produced by endolithic (boring) algae or other microorganisms or through breakdown of mollusc shells. They are difficult to see in a limestone sample except in thin section and are less common in ancient limestones, possibly because compaction of carbonate sediments disrupts them.<br>Limeclasts are fragments of existing limestone or partially lithified carbonate sediments. Intraclasts are limeclasts that originate close to where they are deposited in limestone, while extraclasts come from outside the depositional area. Intraclasts include grapestone, which is clusters of peloids cemented together by organic material or mineral cement. Extraclasts are uncommon, are usually accompanied by other clastic sediments, and indicate deposition in a tectonically active area or as part of a turbidity current.<br>Mud<br>The grains of most limestones are embedded in a matrix of carbonate mud. This is typically the largest fraction of an ancient carbonate rock. Mud consisting of individual crystals less than 5 μm (0.20 mils) in length is described as micrite. In fresh carbonate mud, micrite is mostly small aragonite needles, which may precipitate directly from seawater, be secreted by algae, or be produced by abrasion of carbonate grains in a high-energy environment. This is converted to calcite within a few million years of deposition. Further recrystallization of micrite produces microspar, with grains from 5 to 15 μm (0.20 to 0.59 mils) in diameter.<br>Limestone often contains larger crystals of calcite, ranging in size from 0.02 to 0.1 mm (0.79 to 3.94 mils), that are described as sparry calcite or sparite. Sparite is distinguished from micrite by a grain size of over 20 μm (0.79 mils) and because sparite stands out under a hand lens or in thin section as white or transparent crystals. Sparite is distinguished from carbonate grains by its lack of internal structure and its characteristic crystal shapes.<br>Geologists are careful to distinguish between sparite deposited as cement and sparite formed by recrystallization of micrite or carbonate grains. Sparite cement was likely deposited in pore space between grains, suggesting a high-energy depositional environment that removed carbonate mud. Recrystallized sparite is not diagnostic of depositional environment.<br>Other characteristics<br>The White Cliffs of Dover are composed of chalk.<br>Limestone outcrops are recognized in the field by their softness (calcite and aragonite both have a Mohs hardness of less than 4, well below common silicate minerals) and because limestone bubbles vigorously when a drop of dilute hydrochloric acid is dropped on it. Dolomite is also soft but reacts only feebly with dilute hydrochloric acid, and it usually weathers to a characteristic dull yellow-brown color due to the presence of ferrous iron. This is released and oxidized as the dolomite weathers. Impurities (such as clay, sand, organic remains, iron oxide, and other materials) will cause limestones to exhibit different colors, especially with weathered surfaces.<br>The makeup of a carbonate rock outcrop can be estimated in the field by etching the surface with dilute hydrochloric acid. This etches away the calcite and aragonite, leaving behind any silica or dolomite grains. The latter can be identified by their rhombohedral shape.<br>Crystals of calcite, quartz, dolomite or barite may line small cavities (vugs) in the rock. Vugs are a form of secondary porosity, formed in existing limestone by a change in environment that increases the solubility of calcite.<br>Dense, massive limestone is sometimes described as "marble". For example, the famous Portoro "marble" of Italy is actually a dense black limestone. True marble is produced by recrystallization of limestone during regional metamorphism that accompanies the mountain building process (orogeny). It is distinguished from dense limestone by its coarse crystalline texture and the formation of distinctive minerals from the silica and clay present in the original limestone.<br>Classification<br><br>See also: List of types of limestone<br>Travertine limestone terraces of Pamukkale, Turkey.<br>Cave limestone formations in the Luray Caverns of the northern Shenandoah Valley<br>Two major classification schemes, the Folk and Dunham, are used for identifying the types of carbonate rocks collectively known as limestone.<br>Folk classification<br><br>Main article: Folk's carbonate classification<br>Robert L. Folk developed a classification system that places primary emphasis on the detailed composition of grains and interstitial material in carbonate rocks. Based on composition, there are three main components: allochems (grains), matrix (mostly micrite), and cement (sparite). The Folk system uses two-part names; the first refers to the grains and the second to the cement. For example, a limestone consisting mainly of ooids, with a crystalline matrix, would be termed an oosparite. It is helpful to have a petrographic microscope when using the Folk scheme, because it is easier to determine the components present in each sample.<br>Dunham classification<br><br>Main article: Dunham classification<br>Robert J. Dunham published his system for limestone in 1962. It focuses on the depositional fabric of carbonate rocks. Dunham divides the rocks into four main groups based on relative proportions of coarser clastic particles, based on criteria such as whether the grains were originally in mutual contact, and therefore self-supporting, or whether the rock is characterized by the presence of frame builders and algal mats. Unlike the Folk scheme, Dunham deals with the original porosity of the rock. The Dunham scheme is more useful for hand samples because it is based on texture, not the grains in the sample.<br>A revised classification was proposed by Wright (1992). It adds some diagenetic patterns to the classification scheme.<br>Other descriptive terms<br>Travertine is a term applied to calcium carbonate deposits formed in freshwater environments, particularly waterfalls, cascades and hot springs. Such deposits are typically massive, dense, and banded. When the deposits are highly porous, so that they have a spongelike texture, they are typically described as tufa. Secondary calcite deposited by supersaturated meteoric waters (groundwater) in caves is also sometimes described as travertine. This produces speleothems, such as stalagmites and stalactites.<br>Coquina is a poorly consolidated limestone composed of abraded pieces of coral, shells, or other fossil debris. When better consolidated, it is described as coquinite.<br>Chalk is a soft, earthy, fine-textured limestone composed of the tests of planktonic microorganisms such as foraminifera, while<br>marl is an earthy mixture of carbonates and silicate sediments.

It stated that a 25-year environmental permit issued by the Conservation Environment Protection Authority was in place for Orokolo Bay which was expected to leave a lasting positive legacy for local landowners through the proposed post-mining sustainability land use initiative of a mechanised sago plantation.For the Amazon Bay in Central project, it had significant potential for three high value product streams: vanadium, titanium and iron.“Given the large amount of historic work that has been undertaken by previous explorers at Amazon Bay over many years, we see this as an advanced exploration project’ bringing development synergies with Orokolo Bay.”Previous exploration focused on Amazon Bay as a magnetite resource without fully pursuing its titanium and significant vanadium potential.Next : No need to take action: Oil Search<br><br><br><br>Tags:<br>Iron Sand<br>PNG Mining News<br>Trending News<br><br><br><br><br>Facebook<br>Twitter<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>UTheme - Wordpress Auto Spinner - WP Rocket Free Download - GP Premium Free Download<br><br><br><br>You may like these posts<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Previous Post<br><br><br>Next Post<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Advertisement<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Advertisement
