# Query `97`

## Original Question

*Reviewing market regulatory standards I came across the problem of finding a source that I could cite of concise, worldwide accepted industry geophysical terms.

So far I know Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, SEG Wiki, SPE PetroWiki that give some information on some terms. In practice I need something like this definition in SEG Wiki for seismic crooked lines. Although in this case I don't think the term is well defined.

I am looking for a worldwide industry accepted glossary that I could rely on and cite. The broader it is the best will be for having less problems in future. Where would be the best place to find such source of information? Any other suggestions will be welcome.

The essential problem you're facing is finding a comprehensive and globally recognized source that offers concise definitions of industry-standard geophysical terms for citation purposes. You've already explored resources like the Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, SEG Wiki, and SPE PetroWiki, which provide valuable information on various terms but are seeking a more universally accepted and broader glossary.

To address this need, consider the following steps and sources:

1. **International Associations and Societies**: Organizations that have a global reach and are recognized across the industry often publish glossaries and standards that are widely accepted. For geophysics and related fields, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) are key players. Although you've mentioned SEG Wiki, looking into more official publications or standards issued by these organizations might be beneficial.

2. **International Standards Organizations**: Entities like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develop and publish international standards, including terminology for various industries. Searching through the ISO catalog for standards related to geophysics or specific terms could provide a universally accepted definition. ISO standards are recognized worldwide and would serve as a strong citation source.

3. **Academic and Research Institutions**: Universities and research organizations often publish papers, reports, and glossaries that are highly respected. While these might not always be as broadly recognized as industry standards, they can provide authoritative definitions and are often cited in academic and professional works.

4. **Books and Textbooks**: Look for textbooks and reference books on geophysics and related fields. Authors often include glossaries or dedicate sections to defining terms. Books published by academic presses or renowned authors in the field can serve as excellent citation sources.

5. **Cross-referencing**: Since you're seeking the most universally accepted terms, it could be helpful to cross-reference the definitions you find across the resources mentioned above. If multiple authoritative sources agree on a definition, it underscores its acceptance in the industry.

6. **Professional Networks and Forums**: Engaging with professional networks or forums dedicated to geophysics could also provide insights into which sources industry professionals consider the most authoritative and universally accepted.

In summary, while there might not be a single "one-stop-shop" for all geophysical terms that are recognized worldwide, leveraging a combination of resources from international standards organizations, professional associations, academic publications, and authoritative books can provide a solid foundation for the definitions you need. Cross-referencing these sources can further validate the acceptance and reliability of the terms you wish to cite.

Along with the SEG Wiki Committee, help the Society and the science of applied geophysics with this ambitious project to crowd source the fifth edition of the <iDictionary</i and honor the legacy and scholarship of Robert Sheriff.<br></p<p<bThe SEG Wiki committee and SEG staff seek volunteers with geophysical knowledge to update Robert Sheriff's <iEncyclopedic Dictionary</i on the SEG Wiki.</b These volunteers will write articles based on the content list built by the SEG Wiki Committee. These volunteers will ensure that content is clear, concise, and accurate. Additionally, new entries will model the encyclopedic model (of the SEG Wiki and Wikipedia) over the dictionary style. <br></p<p<a href="/wiki/Fifth_edition_editor" title="Fifth edition editor"Learn more and sign up today!</a<br></p<br><h2<span class="mw-headline" id="Common_editing_tasks"Common editing tasks</span</h2<br><pSince Robert Sheriff conceptualized a written book when completing his work, there are two common issues that detract from the full online experience.

Frequently, references will appear in the articles without proper citations.

Use this page to locate the missing full citations in the Dictionary articles.<br></p<pThe <a href="/wiki/Dictionary:Q(Quality)" title="Dictionary:Q(Quality)"Q article</a has been fixed. <iNote</i: References can be difficult to find since there is not a category listing all of the pages that need references. Many of the articles, including Dictionary figures, will need to have references added.<br></p
