# Query `57`

## Original Question

*If I wanted to make an air shield around the earth to contain exactly half the planet's atmosphere (by mass), how far above sea level would I have to build it?

It's slightly complicated to me because you have to take into consideration the change in pressure as well as the geometric growth of the volume of a sphere as you increase the radius.

Thank you.*

To tackle this intriguing question, we'll break down the problem into several key steps and considerations. The essential problem here is determining the altitude at which a hypothetical barrier would need to be placed around the Earth so that the volume contained within this barrier and the Earth's surface holds exactly half of the total mass of the Earth's atmosphere.

**Step 1: Understanding Atmospheric Pressure and Mass Distribution**

The Earth's atmosphere doesn't have a uniform density; it decreases with altitude due to gravity pulling air molecules closer to the surface. This relationship is described by the barometric formula, which relates atmospheric pressure with altitude. However, for our purposes, we'll simplify the scenario by considering how atmospheric mass is related to pressure and volume.

The total mass of the Earth's atmosphere is approximately \(5.15 \times 10^{18}\) kg. Thus, for our shield to contain half of this mass, it would need to encompass \(2.575 \times 10^{18}\) kg of air.

**Step 2: The Ideal Gas Law and Scale Height**

The Ideal Gas Law, \(PV = nRT\), relates pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T) of a gas, where \(n\) is the amount of substance (in moles) and \(R\) is the ideal gas constant. For the atmosphere, considering it as an ideal gas might simplify calculations, but the varying temperature with altitude and the gravitational pull complicating the density distribution makes direct application challenging.

The scale height is a concept that can simplify understanding how atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude. It's the height over which the pressure decreases by a factor of \(e\) (approximately 2.718). For Earth, the scale height is roughly 8.5 km. However, the exact calculation of the volume of atmosphere contained up to a certain altitude requires integrating the pressure or density changes over that altitude, which is complex due to the non-linear decrease in density with altitude.

**Step 3: Simplification and Approximation**

Given the complexity of accurately calculating the exact altitude, we can make some simplifications. One approach is to consider how the atmospheric pressure halves with every 5.6 km increase in altitude (approximately, and this figure varies based on conditions and assumptions). However, this is a simplification and doesn't directly translate to halving the mass of the atmosphere, due to the non-linear relationship between volume, pressure, and mass with altitude.

**Step 4: Considering the Volume of a Sphere**

The volume of a sphere is given by \(V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius. As the altitude increases, the volume contained within our hypothetical barrier increases at a cubic rate. However, because the density of the atmosphere decreases with altitude, the additional volume contains progressively less mass.

**Conclusion and the Need for Numerical Integration**

To precisely determine the altitude at which a barrier would contain half of the Earth's atmospheric mass, one would need to numerically integrate the mass of the atmosphere over altitude, taking into account the changing density (and therefore mass) with altitude up to the point where the integrated mass equals half of the total atmospheric mass. This is a complex calculation that typically requires computer modeling and a detailed understanding of the atmospheric density profile.

Given these considerations, without performing detailed numerical calculations, we can't provide an exact altitude. However, the concept outlines the complexity and the factors involved in solving this problem. In reality, the altitude at which half of the atmosphere's mass would be contained is likely to be within the lower portion of the stratosphere, considering that the bulk of the atmosphere's mass is concentrated closer to the Earth's surface due to gravitational pull and the exponential decrease in density with altitude.
