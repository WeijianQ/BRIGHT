# Query `112`

## Original Question

*Researchers who are involved in study of life on Mars are saying that there might be multicellular life present on Mars, today or in the past. Which traces, markers or environments on Mars could support this hypothesis and how it will be investigated?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is determining whether multicellular life exists or has existed on Mars, which involves identifying traces, markers, or environments that could support this hypothesis and outlining methods for investigating these potential signs of life.

### Step 1: Identifying Potential Traces or Markers of Multicellular Life

1. **Organic Molecules**: The presence of complex organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life, could indicate the past or present existence of multicellular organisms. These molecules include lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

2. **Morphological Features**: Structures resembling fossils or the remnants of multicellular organisms in Martian rocks or soil could suggest previous life forms. Such features might be identified through imaging technologies.

3. **Biogenic Gases**: The detection of gases in the Martian atmosphere that are typically produced by biological activity (e.g., methane, oxygen) could hint at the presence of life. Fluctuations in these gas concentrations might indicate active biological processes.

4. **Water Ice and Liquid Water Reservoirs**: As water is essential for life as we know it, the presence of water ice and past evidence or current existence of liquid water environments (e.g., subterranean lakes) could be habitats for multicellular life.

5. **Mineral Deposits**: Certain minerals formed in the presence of water, such as clays and sulfates, might indicate regions where life could have existed when liquid water was more prevalent on Mars's surface.

### Step 2: Investigating the Hypothesis

1. **Rovers and Landers**: Robotic missions like the Mars Perseverance Rover and previous rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity) are equipped with instruments capable of detecting organic molecules, analyzing gases in the atmosphere, and capturing high-resolution images of the Martian surface to look for morphological features indicative of life.

2. **Orbiters**: Satellites orbiting Mars can identify promising sites for further exploration by rovers by detecting water ice, underground reservoirs of liquid water, and changes in the composition of the Martian atmosphere.

3. **Sample Return Missions**: Future missions aimed at collecting Martian soil and rock samples and returning them to Earth for analysis could provide definitive evidence of multicellular life. These samples would allow for more sophisticated analyses than what can be conducted by instruments on Mars.

4. **Astrobiological Experiments**: Experiments specifically designed to detect life, such as those that can identify the presence of RNA or DNA, or that can test for metabolic activity directly, would be crucial in confirming the existence of multicellular organisms.

5. **Drilling Technologies**: Since any existing life or evidence of past life may be found below the Martian surface, where conditions are less harsh, drilling technologies that can penetrate the subsurface to retrieve samples are essential.

### Conclusion

Investigating the hypothesis of multicellular life on Mars involves a multi-faceted approach that combines the detection of organic molecules, morphological features, biogenic gases, and the identification of environments where life could potentially exist or have existed. Utilizing a combination of rovers, landers, orbiters, sample return missions, and specialized experiments will be key in addressing this profound question. This endeavor not only requires advanced technology but also an interdisciplinary approach, integrating fields such as biology, geology, chemistry, and astronomy to comprehensively understand the potential for life on Mars.

Scientists believe the area was once flooded with water and was home to an ancient river delta. The process of landing site selection involved a combination of mission team members and scientists from around the world, who carefully examined more than 60 candidate locations on the Red Planet. After the exhaustive five-year study of potential sites, each with its own unique characteristics and appeal, Jezero rose to the top.Jezero Crater tells a story of the on-again, off-again nature of the wet past of Mars. More than 3.5 billion years ago, river channels spilled over the crater wall and created a lake. Scientists see evidence that water carried clay minerals from the surrounding area into the crater lake. Conceivably, microbial life could have lived in Jezero during one or more of these wet times. If so, signs of their remains might be found in lakebed or shoreline sediments. Scientists will study how the region formed and evolved, seek signs of past life, and collect samples of Mars rock and soil that might preserve these signs.Jezero Crater is 28 miles (45 kilometers) wide, and is located on the western edge of a flat plain called Isidis Planitia, which lies just north of the Martian equator. The landing site is about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) from Curiosity's landing site in Gale Crater.This image shows the remains of an ancient delta in Mars' Jezero Crater, which NASA's Perseverance Mars rover will explore for signs of fossilized microbial life.
