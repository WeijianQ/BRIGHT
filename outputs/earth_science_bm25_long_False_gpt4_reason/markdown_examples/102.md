## Original Question

*Is wind just mainly nitrogen particles moving in one direction?
The air is composed of mainly nitrogen. Therefore, when you feel wind, is it mainly nitrogen particles hitting you that, on average, are moving in one direction?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
### Essential Problem:

The core of the inquiry is understanding what wind is composed of, specifically whether the sensation of wind is primarily due to nitrogen particles moving in one direction, given that nitrogen is a major component of Earth's atmosphere.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Composition of Earth's Atmosphere**: The first step is to recognize the composition of Earth's atmosphere. It's widely known that the Earth's atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with the remaining 1% composed of argon, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. Therefore, any movement of air (wind) would predominantly involve these gases, with nitrogen being the majority.

2. **What is Wind?**: Wind is essentially the movement of air from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. This movement is influenced by various factors, including the Earth's rotation, the distribution of land and water masses, and temperature variations. It's important to understand that wind is not a single gas moving but rather a bulk movement of the atmosphere.

3. **Sensation of Wind**: When we feel wind, we are experiencing the kinetic energy of countless molecules (not just nitrogen) moving in a general direction. This includes nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. The sensation is the result of these molecules colliding with our skin, transferring energy in the form of a force we perceive as wind.

4. **Relative Movement of Gases**: It's also relevant to consider that while nitrogen makes up the majority of the atmosphere by volume, the movement we feel as wind is not exclusively due to nitrogen particles. The gases in the atmosphere are thoroughly mixed, so when wind occurs, it involves the collective movement of nitrogen, oxygen, and other atmospheric components.

5. **The Role of Oxygen and Other Gases**: Given the substantial amount of oxygen and other gases in the atmosphere, their contribution to the sensation of wind is non-negligible. For instance, oxygen, making up approximately 21% of the atmosphere, also plays a significant role in the dynamics of wind.

### Conclusion:

When you feel the wind, you are indeed primarily feeling the movement of nitrogen particles, given nitrogen's abundance in the atmosphere. However, it's not exclusively nitrogen. Oxygen and trace amounts of other gases are also moving and contribute to the sensation of wind. The wind is the result of the collective movement of the atmosphere's components, with nitrogen being the most abundant but not the sole contributor. This collective movement is what we experience as wind, a complex and dynamic process influenced by various environmental factors.

This result enables the experimental determination of the Avogadro number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces.

Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature. Within such a fluid, there exists no preferential direction of flow (as in transport phenomena). More specifically, the fluid's overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time. The kinetic energies of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations, sum up to the caloric component of a fluid's internal energy (the equipartition theorem).[citation needed]<br>This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant Clarkia pulchella immersed in water. In 1900, the French mathematician Louis Bachelier modeled the stochastic process now called Brownian motion in his doctoral thesis, The Theory of Speculation (Théorie de la spéculation), prepared under the supervision of Henri Poincaré. Then, in 1905, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen particles as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific contributions.[3]<br>The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter".[4]<br>The many-body interactions that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. Consequently, only probabilistic models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it.[5] Two such models of the statistical mechanics, due to Einstein and Smoluchowski, are presented below. Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the stochastic process models. There exist sequences of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which converge (in the limit) to Brownian motion (see random walk and Donsker's theorem).[6][7]<br><br><br>History[edit]<br>Reproduced from the book of Jean Baptiste Perrin, Les Atomes, three tracings of the motion of colloidal particles of radius 0.53 µm, as seen under the microscope, are displayed. Successive positions every 30 seconds are joined by straight line segments (the mesh size is 3.2 µm).[8]<br>The Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius' scientific poem "On the Nature of Things" (c. 60 BC) has a remarkable description of the motion of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:<br><br>Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.<br>Although the mingling, tumbling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, jiggling motion of small dust particles is caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics; Lucretius "perfectly describes and explains the Brownian movement by a wrong example".[9]<br>While Jan Ingenhousz described the irregular motion of coal dust particles on the surface of alcohol in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying pollen grains of the plant Clarkia pulchella suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.<br>The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was Thorvald N. Thiele in a paper on the method of least squares published in 1880. This was followed independently by Louis Bachelier in 1900 in his PhD thesis "The theory of speculation", in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian motion model of the stock market is often cited, but Benoit Mandelbrot rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous.[10]<br>Albert Einstein (in one of his 1905 papers) and Marian Smoluchowski (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of Jean Baptiste Perrin in 1908.<br><br>Statistical mechanics theories[edit]<br>Einstein's theory[edit]<br>There are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean squared displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities.[11] In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas.[12] In accordance to Avogadro's law, this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as the Avogadro number, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom, since the latter is obtained by dividing the molar mass of the gas by the Avogadro constant.<br><br>The characteristic bell-shaped curves of the diffusion of Brownian particles. The distribution begins as a Dirac delta function, indicating that all the particles are located at the origin at time t = 0. As t increases, the distribution flattens (though remains bell-shaped), and ultimately becomes uniform in the limit that time goes to infinity.<br>The first part of Einstein's argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval.[3] Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second.[2]<br>He regarded the increment of particle positions in time <br><br><br><br>τ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \tau }<br><br> in a one-dimensional (x) space (with the coordinates chosen so that the origin lies at the initial position of the particle) as a random variable (<br><br><br><br>Δ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \Delta }<br><br>) with some probability density function <br><br><br><br>φ<br>(<br>Δ<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \varphi (\Delta )}<br><br> (i.e., <br><br><br><br>φ<br>(<br>Δ<br>)<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \varphi (\Delta )}<br><br> is the probability density for a jump of magnitude <br><br><br><br>Δ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \Delta }<br><br>, i.e., the probability density of the particle incrementing its position from <br><br><br><br>x<br><br><br>{\displaystyle x}<br><br> to <br><br><br><br>x<br>+<br>Δ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle x+\Delta }<br><br> in the time interval <br><br><br><br>τ<br><br><br>{\displaystyle \tau }<br><br>).

By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant R, the temperature T, the viscosity η, and the particle radius r, the Avogadro constant NA can be determined.<br>The type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by J. J. Thomson[14] in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by Fick's law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion "gives us a method of determining Avogadro's Constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other".[14]<br>An identical expression to Einstein's formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by Walther Nernst in 1888[15] in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the osmotic pressure to the ratio of the frictional force and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the law of van 't Hoff while the latter was given by Stokes's law. He writes <br><br><br><br><br>k<br>′<br><br>=<br><br>p<br><br>o<br><br><br><br>/<br><br>k<br><br><br>{\displaystyle k'=p_{o}/k}<br><br> for the diffusion coefficient k', where <br><br><br><br><br>p<br><br>o<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle p_{o}}<br><br> is the osmotic pressure and k is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes's formula for the viscosity. Introducing the ideal gas law per unit volume for the osmotic pressure, the formula becomes identical to that of Einstein's.[16] The use of Stokes's law in Nernst's case, as well as in Einstein and Smoluchowski, is not strictly applicable since it does not apply to the case where the radius of the sphere is small in comparison with the mean free path.[17]<br>At first, the predictions of Einstein's formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value, and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein's formula predicted.[18] But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law.[19]<br><br>Brownian motion model of the trajectory of a particle of dye in water.<br>Smoluchowski model[edit]<br>Smoluchowski's theory of Brownian motion[20] starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution ρ(x, t) for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the x in time t.

Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is of the order of 10−7 cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000 cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.<br>These orders of magnitude are not exact because they don't take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, U, which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger U is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, <br><br><br><br>M<br><br>U<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>/<br><br>2<br><br><br>{\displaystyle MU^{2}/2}<br><br>, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, <br><br><br><br>m<br><br>u<br><br>2<br><br><br><br>/<br><br>2<br><br><br>{\displaystyle mu^{2}/2}<br><br>.<br>In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion.[23] The model assumes collisions with M ≫ m where M is the test particle's mass and m the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of ΔV. If NR is the number of collisions from the right and NL the number of collisions from the left then after N collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by ΔV(2NR − N). The multiplicity is then simply given by:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>(<br><br><br>N<br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br><br><br>)<br><br><br><br>=<br><br><br><br>N<br>!<br><br><br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>!<br>(<br>N<br>−<br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>)<br>!<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle {\binom {N}{N_{\rm {R}}}}={\frac {N!}{N_{\rm {R}}!(N-N_{\rm {R}})!}}}<br><br><br>and the total number of possible states is given by 2N. Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right NR times is:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>P<br><br>N<br><br><br>(<br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>)<br>=<br><br><br><br>N<br>!<br><br><br><br>2<br><br>N<br><br><br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>!<br>(<br>N<br>−<br><br>N<br><br><br>R<br><br><br><br>)<br>!<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle P_{N}(N_{\rm {R}})={\frac {N!}{2^{N}N_{\rm {R}}!(N-N_{\rm {R}})!}}}<br><br><br>As a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid, many of the assumptions don't apply. For example, the assumption that on average occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible ΔVs instead of always just one in a realistic situation.<br><br>Other physics models using partial differential equations[edit]<br>The diffusion equation yields an approximation of the time evolution of the probability density function associated with the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on short timescales.<br>The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself is best described using the Langevin equation, an equation that involves a random force field representing the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the solvent on the particle. In Langevin dynamics and Brownian dynamics, the Langevin equation is used to efficiently simulate the dynamics of molecular systems that exhibit a strong Brownian component.<br>The displacement of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the diffusion equation under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the rms of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave nonsensical results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.<br>At very short time scales, however, the motion of a particle is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: Δx = vΔt. So the instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as v = Δx/Δt, when Δt << τ, where τ is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with optical tweezers) was measured successfully.[24] The velocity data verified the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.<br><br>Astrophysics: star motion within galaxies[edit]<br>In stellar dynamics, a massive body (star, black hole, etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to gravitational forces from surrounding stars.[25] The rms velocity V of the massive object, of mass M, is related to the rms velocity <br><br><br><br><br>v<br><br>⋆<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle v_{\star }}<br><br> of the background stars by<br><br><br><br><br><br>M<br><br>V<br><br>2<br><br><br>≈<br>m<br><br>v<br><br>⋆<br><br><br>2<br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle MV^{2}\approx mv_{\star }^{2}}<br><br><br>where <br><br><br><br>m<br>≪<br>M<br><br><br>{\displaystyle m\ll M}<br><br> is the mass of the background stars.
