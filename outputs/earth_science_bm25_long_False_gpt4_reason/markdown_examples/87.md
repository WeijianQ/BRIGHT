# Query `87`

## Original Question

*The image below is included in the BBC article Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor. Apparently this phenomenon is sometimes called a "fog-bow" and is characterized by the washing out of perceived color relative to a conventional rainbow.
Is this related to the geometry (fog being far closer to the viewer) or properties of the droplets themselves? If so, which properties and why?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to understand why a fog-bow, as described in the mentioned BBC article, appears mostly white and how this phenomenon differs from the more colorful conventional rainbows. This involves exploring whether the phenomenon's cause is related to the geometry (the proximity of fog to the viewer) or the properties of the droplets that make up the fog. To address this, we need to consider the physics of light interaction with water droplets, including reflection, refraction, and diffraction, and how these might vary between the conditions producing a fog-bow and those producing a regular rainbow.

### Step 1: Understanding How Rainbows Form
Conventional rainbows form when sunlight is refracted as it enters a raindrop, reflects off the back of the drop, and is refracted again as it exits the drop. This process splits the sunlight into its component colors, creating a spectrum. The size of the raindrops is significant because it affects the angles at which light is refracted and how sharply the different colors are separated.

### Step 2: Differences in Droplet Size
Fog is made up of much smaller water droplets than rain. The tiny droplets in fog are usually less than 0.05 mm in diameter, whereas raindrops can range from 0.5 mm to several millimeters in diameter. This size difference significantly affects how light interacts with the droplets.

### Step 3: The Role of Droplet Size in Color Dispersion
The smaller droplets in fog are not as effective at dispersing the different wavelengths (colors) of light. When sunlight hits these tiny droplets, the light is diffracted, or spread out, rather than being refracted and separated into a spectrum. Diffraction blurs the colors together because the smaller droplets scatter the light in many directions, reducing the separation of colors that is necessary for a vivid rainbow. This is a key property of the droplets that influences the appearance of a fog-bow.

### Step 4: The Impact of Viewer Proximity
While the geometry or proximity of the fog to the viewer might seem relevant, it is not the primary reason for the color differences between a fog-bow and a rainbow. Regardless of the distance, the critical factor is how the light is dispersed by the water droplets. However, the viewing angle can affect the visibility of a fog-bow, as it is often fainter than a rainbow and may require the viewer to be at a specific angle relative to the fog and the light source (typically with the sun behind the viewer).

### Conclusion
In summary, the primary reason a fog-bow appears mostly white and lacks the vibrant colors of a conventional rainbow is due to the properties of the water droplets that make up the fog, specifically their small size. This small size leads to diffraction rather than refraction, causing the colors to blend together and appear washed out or white. The proximity of the fog to the viewer (geometry) is less significant in determining the coloration of the fog-bow; the crucial factor is the physical interaction of light with the tiny droplets in the fog.

> much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon is also known as a stacker rainbow. The supernumerary bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern.[38] The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller
