## Original Question

*It is said about ozone:

a layer in the earth's stratosphere at an altitude of about 10 km (6.2 miles) containing a high concentration of ozone

Over the Earth’s surface, the ozone layer’s average thickness is about 300 Dobson Units or a layer that is 3 millimetres thick. (nasa)

So, how does the Ozone gas stays in that altitude without dissolving?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here involves understanding why ozone gas (O3) remains concentrated in a specific layer of the Earth's stratosphere, rather than dispersing evenly throughout the atmosphere or dissolving into other layers.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Atmosphere's Composition and Structure**:
   - The Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with distinct characteristics. The layers are primarily defined by temperature gradients, and they include the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.
   - The stratosphere is the second layer of the atmosphere, situated above the troposphere and below the mesosphere, ranging from about 10 km to 50 km in altitude.

2. **Ozone Formation**:
   - Ozone in the stratosphere is primarily formed through a process involving ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. When UV radiation strikes oxygen molecules (O2), it causes them to split into individual oxygen atoms. These atoms can then combine with unbroken O2 molecules to form ozone (O3).
   - This process is most efficient in the stratosphere because the intensity of UV radiation is just right—strong enough to split oxygen molecules but not so strong as to immediately break down the newly formed ozone.

3. **Why Ozone Stays Concentrated in the Stratosphere**:
   - **Temperature Gradient**: The stratosphere has a temperature gradient where it gets warmer at higher altitudes, unlike the troposphere below it. This temperature increase is due to the absorption of UV radiation by ozone, which heats the surrounding air. This warmer air tends to stay in the stratosphere, helping to keep the ozone layer stable.
   - **Chemical Stability**: Ozone molecules are more stable in the stratosphere's conditions. The concentration of ozone peaks at this altitude because the balance between ozone formation and destruction processes is optimal here.
   - **Atmospheric Dynamics**: The stratosphere is characterized by relatively stable atmospheric conditions and lacks the weather-related turbulence found in the troposphere. This stability helps prevent the ozone from being dispersed into lower layers by large-scale atmospheric movements.

4. **Prevention of Dissolution**:
   - The concept of "dissolving" applies more to the mixing of gases or solutes in liquids. In the context of gases in the atmosphere, we're looking at dispersion and mixing. Ozone doesn't "dissolve" into other layers so much as it is formed and remains most stable in the stratosphere due to the factors mentioned above.
   - The layers of the atmosphere don't mix thoroughly due to the temperature inversions and differences in air composition. This stratification helps keep ozone primarily in the stratosphere.

### Conclusion

Ozone remains concentrated in the stratosphere due to a combination of factors including the specific conditions that favor its formation and stability there, such as UV radiation levels, temperature gradients, and atmospheric stability. These factors collectively ensure that ozone is not only produced most efficiently at this altitude but also remains there instead of evenly dispersing throughout the Earth's atmosphere or "dissolving" into other layers.

> part3 -------------------<br>Main reactions in different atmospheric layers[edit]<br>Thermosphere[edit]<br>For given relative reactants concentrations, The rates of ozone creation and oxygen recombination (reactions 2 and 5) are proportional to the air density cubed, while the rate of ozone conversion (reaction 4) is proportional to the air density squared, and the photodissociation reactions (reactions 1 and 3) have a linear dependence on air density. Thus, at the upper thermosphere, where air density is very low and photon flux is high, oxygen photodissociation is fast while ozone creation is low, thus its concentration is low. Thus the most important reactions are oxygen photodissociation and oxygen recombination, with most of the oxygen molecules dissociated to oxygen atoms.<br>As we go to the lower thermosphere (e.g. 100 km height and below), the photon flux in the <170 nm wavelengths drops sharply due to absorption by oxygen in the oxygen photodissociation reaction (reaction 1). This wavelength regime has the highest cross section for this reaction (10 cm per oxygen molecule), and thus the rate of oxygen photodissociation per oxygen molecule decreases significantly at these altitudes, from more than 10 per second (about once a month) at 100 km to 10 per second (about once every few years) at 80 km . As a result, the atomic oxygen concentration (both relative and absolute) decreases sharply, and ozone creation (reaction 2) is ongoing, leading to a small but non-negligible ozone presence.<br>Note that temperatures also drop as altitude decreases, because lower photon photodissociation rates mean lower heat production per air molecule.<br>Below thermosphere: Reaction rates at steady state[edit]<br>Odd oxygen species (atomic oxygen and ozone) have net creation rate only by oxygen dissociation (reaction 1), and net destruction by either ozone conversion or oxygen recombination (reactions 4 and 5). At steady state these processes are balanced, so the rates of these reactions obey:<br>(rate of reaction 1) = (rate of reaction 4) + (rate of reaction 5).<br>At steady state, ozone creation is also balanced with its removal. so:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 4).<br>It thus follows that:<br>(rate of reaction 2) + (rate of reaction 5) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 1).<br>The right-hand side is the total photodissociation rate, of either oxygen or ozone.<br>Below the thermosphere, the atomic oxygen concentration is very low compared to molecular oxygen. Therefore, oxygen atoms are much more likely to hit oxygen (diatomic) molecules than to hit other oxygen atoms, making oxygen recombination (reaction 5) far rarer than ozone creation (reaction 2). Following the steady-state relation between the reaction rates, we may therefore approximate:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 1)<br>Mesosphere[edit]<br>In the mesosphere, oxygen photodissociation dominates over ozone photodissociation, so we have approximately:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 1) =  (rate of reaction 4)<br>Thus, ozone is mainly removed by ozone conversion. Both ozone creation and conversion depend linearly on oxygen atom concentration, but in ozone creation an oxygen atom must encounter an oxygen molecule and another air molecule (typically nitrogen) simultaneously, while in ozone conversion an oxygen atom must only encounter an ozone molecule. Thus, when both reactions are balanced, the ratio between ozone and molecular oxygen concentrations is approximately proportional to air density.<br>Therefore, the relative ozone concentration is higher at lower altitudes, where air density is higher. This trend continues to some extent lower into the stratosphere, and thus as we go from 60 km to 30 km altitude, both air density and ozone relative concentration increase by ~40-50-fold.<br>Stratosphere[edit]<br>Absorption by oxygen in the mesosphere and thermosphere (in the oxygen photodissociation reaction) reduces photon flux at wavelengths below 200 nanometer, where oxygen photodissociation is dominated by Schumann–Runge bands and continuum, with cross-section of up to 10 cm.<br>Due to this absorption, photon flux in these wavelengths is so low in the stratosphere, that oxygen photodissociation becomes dominated by the Hertzberg band of the 200-240 nm photon wavelength, even though the cross-section of this process is as low as 10 - 10 cm. The ozone photodissociation rate per ozone molecule has a cross-section 6 orders of magnitude higher in the 220-300 nm wavelength range. With ozone concentrations in the order of 10-10 relative to molecular oxygen, ozone photodissociation becomes the dominant photodissociation reaction, and most of the stratosphere heat is generated through this procsees, with highest heat generation rate per molecule at the upper limit of the stratosphere (stratopause), where ozone concentration is already relatively high while UV flux is still high as well in those wavelengths, before being depleted by this same photodissociation process.<br>In addition to ozone photodissociation becoming a more dominant removal reaction, catalytic ozone destruction due to free radicals (mainly atomic hydrogen, hydroxyl, nitric oxide, chlorine and bromide) increases the effective ozone conversion reaction rate. Both processes act to increase ozone removal, leading to a more moderate increase of ozone relative concentration as altitude decreases, even though air density continues to increase.<br>Due to both ozone and oxygen growing density as we go to lower altitudes, UV photon flux at wavelengths below 300 nm decreases substantially, and oxygen photodissociation rates fall below 10 per second per molecule at 30 km. With decreasing oxygen photodissociation rates, odd-oxygen species (atomic oxygen and ozone molecules) are hardly formed de novo (rather than being transmuted to each other by the other reactions), and most atomic oxygen needed for ozone creation is derived almost exclusively from ozone removal by ozone photodissociation. Thus, ozone becomes depleted as we go below 30 km altitude and reaches very low concentrations at the tropopause.<br>Troposphere[edit]<br>In the troposphere, ozone formation and destruction are no longer controlled by the ozone-oxygen cycle. Rather, tropospheric ozone chemistry is dominated today by industrial pollutants other gases of volcanic source.

It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude.

The CFCs have still higher boiling points because the chloride is even more polarizable than fluoride. Because of their polarity, the CFCs are useful solvents, and their boiling points make them suitable as refrigerants.

This "atmospheric window" absorption is intensified by the low concentration of each individual CFC. Because CO2 is close to saturation with high concentrations and few infrared absorption bands, the radiation budget and hence the greenhouse effect has low sensitivity to changes in CO2 concentration; the increase in temperature is roughly logarithmic.

Later in the 1920s after a series of fatal accidents involving the leaking of chloromethane from refrigerators, a major collaborative effort began between American corporations Frigidaire, General Motors, and DuPont to develop a safer, non-toxic alternative. Thomas Midgley Jr. of General Motors is credited for synthesizing the first chlorofluorocarbons. The Frigidaire corporation was issued the first patent, number 1,886,339, for the formula for CFCs on December 31, 1928. In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it to blow out a candle in 1930.<br>By 1930, General Motors and Du Pont formed the Kinetic Chemical Company to produce Freon, and by 1935, over 8 million refrigerators utilizing R-12 were sold by Frigidaire and its competitors. In 1932, Carrier began using R-11 in the worlds first self-contained home air conditioning unit known as the "atmospheric cabinet". As a result of CFCs being largely non-toxic, they quickly became the coolant of choice in large air-conditioning systems. Public health codes in cities were revised to designate chlorofluorocarbons as the only gases that could be used as refrigerants in public buildings.<br>Growth in CFCs continued over the following decades leading to peak annual sales of over 1 billion USD with greater than 1 million metric tonnes being produced annually. It wasn't until 1974 that it was first discovered by two University of California chemists, Professor F. Sherwood Rowland and Dr. Mario Molina, that the use of chlorofluorocarbons were causing a significant depletion in atmospheric ozone concentrations. This initiated the environmental effort which eventually resulted in the enactment of the Montreal Protocol.<br>Commercial development and use in fire extinguishing[edit]<br><br>During World War II, various chloroalkanes were in standard use in military aircraft, although these early halons suffered from excessive toxicity. Nevertheless, after the war they slowly became more common in civil aviation as well. In the 1960s, fluoroalkanes and bromofluoroalkanes became available and were quickly recognized as being highly effective fire-fighting materials. Much early research with Halon 1301 was conducted under the auspices of the US Armed Forces, while Halon 1211 was, initially, mainly developed in the UK. By the late 1960s they were standard in many applications where water and dry-powder extinguishers posed a threat of damage to the protected property, including computer rooms, telecommunications switches, laboratories, museums and art collections. Beginning with warships, in the 1970s, bromofluoroalkanes also progressively came to be associated with rapid knockdown of severe fires in confined spaces with minimal risk to personnel.<br>By the early 1980s, bromofluoroalkanes were in common use on aircraft, ships, and large vehicles as well as in computer facilities and galleries. However, concern was beginning to be expressed about the impact of chloroalkanes and bromoalkanes on the ozone layer. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer did not cover bromofluoroalkanes under the same restrictions, instead, the consumption of bromofluoroalkanes was frozen at 1986 levels. This is due to the fact that emergency discharge of extinguishing systems was thought to be too small in volume to produce a significant impact, and too important to human safety for restriction.<br>Regulation[edit]<br>Since the late 1970s, the use of CFCs has been heavily regulated because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer. After the development of his electron capture detector, James Lovelock was the first to detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC-11 over Ireland. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features—their low reactivity—is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere. Once in the stratosphere, the sun's ultraviolet radiation is strong enough to cause the homolytic cleavage of the C-Cl bond. In 1976, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the EPA banned commercial manufacturing and use of CFCs and aerosol propellants. This was later superseded in the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to address stratospheric ozone depletion.<br>NASA projection of stratospheric ozone, in Dobson units, if chlorofluorocarbons had not been banned. Animated version.<br>By 1987, in response to a dramatic seasonal depletion of the ozone layer over Antarctica, diplomats in Montreal forged a treaty, the Montreal Protocol, which called for drastic reductions in the production of CFCs. On 2 March 1989, 12 European Community nations agreed to ban the production of all CFCs by the end of the century. In 1990, diplomats met in London and voted to significantly strengthen the Montreal Protocol by calling for a complete elimination of CFCs by 2000. By 2010, CFCs should have been completely eliminated from developing countries as well.<br>Ozone-depleting gas trends<br>Because the only CFCs available to countries adhering to the treaty is from recycling, their prices have increased considerably. A worldwide end to production should also terminate the smuggling of this material. However, there are current CFC smuggling issues, as recognized by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) in a 2006 report titled "Illegal Trade in Ozone Depleting Substances". UNEP estimates that between 16,000–38,000 tonnes of CFCs passed through the black market in the mid-1990s. The report estimated between 7,000 and 14,000 tonnes of CFCs are smuggled annually into developing countries. Asian countries are those with the most smuggling; as of 2007, China, India and South Korea were found to account for around 70% of global CFC production, South Korea later to ban CFC production in 2010. Possible reasons for continued CFC smuggling were also examined: the report noted that many of the refrigeration systems that were designed   to be operated utilizing the banned CFC products have long lifespans and continue to operate. The cost of replacing the equipment of these items is sometimes cheaper than outfitting them with a more ozone-friendly appliance. Additionally, CFC smuggling is not considered a significant issue, so the perceived penalties for smuggling are low. In 2018 public attention was drawn to the issue, that at an unknown place in east Asia an estimated amount of 13,000 metric tons annually of CFCs have been produced since about 2012 in violation of the protocol. While the eventual phaseout of CFCs is likely, efforts are being taken to stem these current non-compliance problems.<br>By the time of the Montreal Protocol, it was realised that deliberate and accidental discharges during system tests and maintenance accounted for substantially larger volumes than emergency discharges, and consequently halons were brought into the treaty, albeit with many exceptions.<br>Regulatory gap[edit]<br>While the production and consumption of CFCs are regulated under the Montreal Protocol, emissions from existing banks of CFCs are not regulated under the agreement. In 2002, there were an estimated 5,791 kilotons of CFCs in existing products such as refrigerators, air conditioners, aerosol cans and others. Approximately one-third of these CFCs are projected to be emitted over the next decade if action is not taken, posing a threat to both the ozone layer and the climate. A proportion of these CFCs can be safely captured and destroyed by means of high temperature, controlled incineration which destroys the CFC molecule.<br>Regulation and DuPont[edit]<br>In 1978 the United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans, the beginning of a long series of regulatory actions against their use. The critical DuPont manufacturing patent for Freon ("Process for Fluorinating Halohydrocarbons", U.S. Patent #3258500) was set to expire in 1979. In conjunction with other industrial peers DuPont formed a lobbying group, the "Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy", to combat regulations of ozone-depleting compounds. In 1986 DuPont, with new patents in hand, reversed its previous stance and publicly condemned CFCs. DuPont representatives appeared before the Montreal Protocol urging that CFCs be banned worldwide and stated that their new HCFCs would meet the worldwide demand for refrigerants.<br>Phasing-out of CFCs[edit]<br>Use of certain chloroalkanes as solvents for large scale application, such as dry cleaning, have been phased out, for example, by the IPPC directive on greenhouse gases in 1994 and by the volatile organic compounds (VOC) directive of the EU in 1997. Permitted chlorofluoroalkane uses are medicinal only.<br>Bromofluoroalkanes have been largely phased out and the possession of equipment for their use is prohibited in some countries like the Netherlands and Belgium, from 1 January 2004, based on the Montreal Protocol and guidelines of the European Union.<br>Production of new stocks ceased in most (probably all) countries in 1994. However many countries still require aircraft to be fitted with halon fire suppression systems because no safe and completely satisfactory alternative has been discovered for this application. There are also a few other, highly specialized uses. These programs recycle halon through "halon banks" coordinated by the Halon Recycling Corporation to ensure that discharge to the atmosphere occurs only in a genuine emergency and to conserve remaining stocks.<br>The interim replacements for CFCs are hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which deplete stratospheric ozone, but to a much lesser extent than CFCs. Ultimately, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) will replace HCFCs. Unlike CFCs and HCFCs, HFCs have an ozone depletion potential (ODP) of 0. DuPont began producing hydrofluorocarbons as alternatives to Freon in the 1980s. These included Suva refrigerants and Dymel propellants. Natural refrigerants are climate friendly solutions that are enjoying increasing support from large companies and governments interested in reducing global warming emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning.<br>Phasing-out of HFCs and HCFCs[edit]<br>Hydrofluorocarbons are included in the Kyoto Protocol and are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol due to their very high Global Warming Potential and the recognition of halocarbon contributions to climate change.<br>On September 21, 2007, approximately 200 countries agreed to accelerate the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons entirely by 2020 in a United Nations-sponsored Montreal summit. Developing nations were given until 2030. Many nations, such as the United States and China, who had previously resisted such efforts, agreed with the accelerated phase out schedule. India successfully phased out HCFCs by 2020.<br>Properly collecting, controlling, and destroying CFCs and HCFCs[edit]<br>While new production of these refrigerants has been banned, large volumes still exist in older systems and pose an immediate threat to our environment. Preventing the release of these harmful refrigerants has been ranked as one of the single most effective actions we can take to mitigate catastrophic climate change.<br>Development of alternatives for CFCs[edit]<br>Work on alternatives for chlorofluorocarbons in refrigerants began in the late 1970s after the first warnings of damage to stratospheric ozone were published.<br>The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are less stable in the lower atmosphere, enabling them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, HFC-134a, were used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) were also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the US and many other countries, as they had excellent thermodynamic properties and performed particularly well in high ambient temperatures. 1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141b) has replaced HFC-134a, due to its low ODP and GWP values. And according to the Montreal Protocol, HCFC-141b is supposed to be phased out completely and replaced with zero ODP substances such as cyclopentane, HFOs, and HFC-345a before January 2020.<br>Among the natural refrigerants (along with ammonia and carbon dioxide), hydrocarbons have negligible environmental impacts and are also used worldwide in domestic and commercial refrigeration applications, and are becoming available in new split system air conditioners.<br>Various other solvents and methods have replaced the use of CFCs in laboratory analytics.<br>In Metered-dose inhalers (MDI), a non-ozone effecting substitute was developed as a propellant, known as "hydrofluoroalkane."<br>Applications and replacements for CFCs<br><br><br>Application<br><br>Previously used CFC<br><br>Replacement<br><br><br>Refrigeration & air-conditioning<br><br>CFC-12 (CCl2F2); CFC-11(CCl3F); CFC-13(CClF3); HCFC-22 (CHClF2); CFC-113 (Cl2FCCClF2); CFC-114 (CClF2CClF2); CFC-115 (CF3CClF2);<br><br>HFC-23 (CHF3); HFC-134a (CF3CFH2); HFC-507 (a 1:1 azeotropic mixture of HFC 125 (CF3 CHF2) and HFC-143a (CF3CH3)); HFC 410 (a 1:1 azeotropic mixture of HFC-32 (CF2H2) and HFC-125 (CF3CF2H))<br><br><br>Propellants in medicinal aerosols<br><br>CFC-114 (CClF2CClF2)<br><br>HFC-134a (CF3CFH2); HFC-227ea (CF3CHFCF3)<br><br><br>Blowing agents for foams<br><br>CFC-11 (CCl3F); CFC 113 (Cl2FCCClF2); HCFC-141b (CCl2FCH3)<br><br>HFC-245fa (CF3CH2CHF2); HFC-365 mfc (CF3CH2CF2CH3)<br><br><br>Solvents, degreasing agents, cleaning agents<br><br>CFC-11 (CCl3F); CFC-113 (CCl2FCClF2)<br><br>HCFC-225cb (C3HCl2F5)<br>Development of Hydrofluoroolefins as alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs[edit]<br><br>Main article: Hydrofluoroolefins<br>The development of Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) as replacements for Hydrochlorofluorocarbons and Hydrofluorocarbons began after the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2016, which called for the phase out of high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants and to replace them with other refrigerants with a lower GWP, closer to that of carbon dioxide. HFOs have an ozone depletion potential of 0.0, compared to the 1.0 of principal CFC-11, and a low GWP which make them environmentally safer alternatives to CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs.<br>Hydrofluoroolefins serve as functional replacements for applications where high GWP hydrofluorocarbons were once used. In April 2022, the EPA signed a pre-published final rule  Listing of HFO-1234yf under the Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning in Nonroad Vehicles and Servicing Fittings for Small Refrigerant Cans. This ruling allows HFO-1234yf to take over in applications where ozone depleting CFCs such as R-12, and high GWP HFCs such as R-134a were once used. The phaseout and replacement of CFCs and HFCs in the automotive industry will ultimately reduce the release of these gases to atmosphere and intern have a positive contribution to the mitigation of climate change.

> part3 -------------------<br>Main reactions in different atmospheric layers[edit]<br>Thermosphere[edit]<br>For given relative reactants concentrations, The rates of ozone creation and oxygen recombination (reactions 2 and 5) are proportional to the air density cubed, while the rate of ozone conversion (reaction 4) is proportional to the air density squared, and the photodissociation reactions (reactions 1 and 3) have a linear dependence on air density. Thus, at the upper thermosphere, where air density is very low and photon flux is high, oxygen photodissociation is fast while ozone creation is low, thus its concentration is low. Thus the most important reactions are oxygen photodissociation and oxygen recombination, with most of the oxygen molecules dissociated to oxygen atoms.<br>As we go to the lower thermosphere (e.g. 100 km height and below), the photon flux in the <170 nm wavelengths drops sharply due to absorption by oxygen in the oxygen photodissociation reaction (reaction 1). This wavelength regime has the highest cross section for this reaction (10 cm per oxygen molecule), and thus the rate of oxygen photodissociation per oxygen molecule decreases significantly at these altitudes, from more than 10 per second (about once a month) at 100 km to 10 per second (about once every few years) at 80 km . As a result, the atomic oxygen concentration (both relative and absolute) decreases sharply, and ozone creation (reaction 2) is ongoing, leading to a small but non-negligible ozone presence.<br>Note that temperatures also drop as altitude decreases, because lower photon photodissociation rates mean lower heat production per air molecule.<br>Below thermosphere: Reaction rates at steady state[edit]<br>Odd oxygen species (atomic oxygen and ozone) have net creation rate only by oxygen dissociation (reaction 1), and net destruction by either ozone conversion or oxygen recombination (reactions 4 and 5). At steady state these processes are balanced, so the rates of these reactions obey:<br>(rate of reaction 1) = (rate of reaction 4) + (rate of reaction 5).<br>At steady state, ozone creation is also balanced with its removal. so:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 4).<br>It thus follows that:<br>(rate of reaction 2) + (rate of reaction 5) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 1).<br>The right-hand side is the total photodissociation rate, of either oxygen or ozone.<br>Below the thermosphere, the atomic oxygen concentration is very low compared to molecular oxygen. Therefore, oxygen atoms are much more likely to hit oxygen (diatomic) molecules than to hit other oxygen atoms, making oxygen recombination (reaction 5) far rarer than ozone creation (reaction 2). Following the steady-state relation between the reaction rates, we may therefore approximate:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 3) + (rate of reaction 1)<br>Mesosphere[edit]<br>In the mesosphere, oxygen photodissociation dominates over ozone photodissociation, so we have approximately:<br>(rate of reaction 2) = (rate of reaction 1) =  (rate of reaction 4)<br>Thus, ozone is mainly removed by ozone conversion. Both ozone creation and conversion depend linearly on oxygen atom concentration, but in ozone creation an oxygen atom must encounter an oxygen molecule and another air molecule (typically nitrogen) simultaneously, while in ozone conversion an oxygen atom must only encounter an ozone molecule. Thus, when both reactions are balanced, the ratio between ozone and molecular oxygen concentrations is approximately proportional to air density.<br>Therefore, the relative ozone concentration is higher at lower altitudes, where air density is higher. This trend continues to some extent lower into the stratosphere, and thus as we go from 60 km to 30 km altitude, both air density and ozone relative concentration increase by ~40-50-fold.<br>Stratosphere[edit]<br>Absorption by oxygen in the mesosphere and thermosphere (in the oxygen photodissociation reaction) reduces photon flux at wavelengths below 200 nanometer, where oxygen photodissociation is dominated by Schumann–Runge bands and continuum, with cross-section of up to 10 cm.<br>Due to this absorption, photon flux in these wavelengths is so low in the stratosphere, that oxygen photodissociation becomes dominated by the Hertzberg band of the 200-240 nm photon wavelength, even though the cross-section of this process is as low as 10 - 10 cm. The ozone photodissociation rate per ozone molecule has a cross-section 6 orders of magnitude higher in the 220-300 nm wavelength range. With ozone concentrations in the order of 10-10 relative to molecular oxygen, ozone photodissociation becomes the dominant photodissociation reaction, and most of the stratosphere heat is generated through this procsees, with highest heat generation rate per molecule at the upper limit of the stratosphere (stratopause), where ozone concentration is already relatively high while UV flux is still high as well in those wavelengths, before being depleted by this same photodissociation process.<br>In addition to ozone photodissociation becoming a more dominant removal reaction, catalytic ozone destruction due to free radicals (mainly atomic hydrogen, hydroxyl, nitric oxide, chlorine and bromide) increases the effective ozone conversion reaction rate. Both processes act to increase ozone removal, leading to a more moderate increase of ozone relative concentration as altitude decreases, even though air density continues to increase.<br>Due to both ozone and oxygen growing density as we go to lower altitudes, UV photon flux at wavelengths below 300 nm decreases substantially, and oxygen photodissociation rates fall below 10 per second per molecule at 30 km. With decreasing oxygen photodissociation rates, odd-oxygen species (atomic oxygen and ozone molecules) are hardly formed de novo (rather than being transmuted to each other by the other reactions), and most atomic oxygen needed for ozone creation is derived almost exclusively from ozone removal by ozone photodissociation. Thus, ozone becomes depleted as we go below 30 km altitude and reaches very low concentrations at the tropopause.<br>Troposphere[edit]<br>In the troposphere, ozone formation and destruction are no longer controlled by the ozone-oxygen cycle. Rather, tropospheric ozone chemistry is dominated today by industrial pollutants other gases of volcanic source.

> part8 -------------------<br>Tracer of ocean circulation[edit]<br>Since the time history of CFC concentrations in the atmosphere is relatively well known, they have provided an important constraint on ocean circulation. CFCs dissolve in seawater at the ocean surface and are subsequently transported into the ocean interior. Because CFCs are inert, their concentration in the ocean interior reflects simply the convolution of their atmospheric time evolution and ocean circulation and mixing.<br>CFC and SF6 tracer-derived age of ocean water[edit]<br>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are anthropogenic compounds that have been released into the atmosphere since the 1930s in various applications such as in air-conditioning, refrigeration, blowing agents in foams, insulations and packing materials, propellants in aerosol cans, and as solvents.  The entry of CFCs into the ocean makes them extremely useful as transient tracers to estimate rates and pathways of ocean circulation and mixing processes. However, due to production restrictions of CFCs in the 1980s, atmospheric concentrations of CFC-11 and CFC-12 has stopped increasing, and the CFC-11 to CFC-12 ratio in the atmosphere have been steadily decreasing, making water dating of water masses more problematic. Incidentally, production and release of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have rapidly increased in the atmosphere since the 1970s. Similar to CFCs, SF6 is also an inert gas and is not affected by oceanic chemical or biological activities. Thus, using CFCs in concert with SF6 as a tracer resolves the water dating issues due to decreased CFC concentrations.<br>Using CFCs or SF6 as a tracer of ocean circulation allows for the derivation of rates for ocean processes due to the time-dependent source function. The elapsed time since a subsurface water mass was last in contact with the atmosphere is the tracer-derived age. Estimates of age can be derived based on the partial pressure of an individual compound and the ratio of the partial pressure of CFCs to each other (or SF6).<br>Partial pressure and ratio dating techniques[edit]<br>The age of a water parcel can be estimated by the CFC partial pressure (pCFC) age or SF6 partial pressure (pSF6) age. The pCFC age of a water sample is defined as:<br>p<br>C<br>F<br>C<br>=<br><br><br><br>[<br>C<br>F<br>C<br>]<br><br><br>F<br>(<br>T<br>,<br>S<br>)<br><br><br><br><br><br>{\displaystyle pCFC={\frac {[CFC]}{F(T,S)}}}<br>where [CFC] is the measured CFC concentration (pmol kg) and F is the solubility of CFC gas in seawater as a function of temperature and salinity.

The solubility measurements of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have been previously measured by Warner and Weiss Additionally, the solubility measurement of CFC-113 was measured by Bu and Warner and SF6 by Wanninkhof et al. and Bullister et al.

The difference between the corresponding date and the collection date of the seawater sample is the average age for the water parcel. The age of a parcel of water can also be calculated using the ratio of two CFC partial pressures or the ratio of the SF6 partial pressure to a CFC partial pressure.

Isomers, which are common for ethane and propane derivatives, are indicated by letters following the numbers:<br>Principal CFCs<br><br><br>Systematic name<br><br>Common/trivial name(s), code<br><br>Boiling point (°C)<br><br>Formula<br><br><br>Trichlorofluoromethane<br><br>Freon-11, R-11, CFC-11<br><br>23.77<br><br>CCl3F<br><br><br>Dichlorodifluoromethane<br><br>Freon-12, R-12, CFC-12<br><br>−29.8<br><br>CCl2F2<br><br><br>Chlorotrifluoromethane<br><br>Freon-13, R-13, CFC-13<br><br>−81<br><br>CClF3<br><br><br>Dichlorofluoromethane<br><br>R-21, HCFC-21<br><br>8.9<br><br>CHCl2F<br><br><br>Chlorodifluoromethane<br><br>R-22, HCFC-22<br><br>−40.8<br><br>CHClF2<br><br><br>Chlorofluoromethane<br><br>Freon 31, R-31, HCFC-31<br><br>−9.1<br><br>CH2ClF<br><br><br>Bromochlorodifluoromethane<br><br>BCF, Halon 1211, H-1211, Freon 12B1<br><br>−3.7<br><br>CBrClF2<br><br><br>1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane<br><br>Freon 113, R-113, CFC-113, 1,1,2-Trichlorotrifluoroethane<br><br>47.7<br><br>Cl2FC-CClF2<br><br><br>1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane<br><br>Freon 113a, R-113a, CFC-113a<br><br>45.9<br><br>Cl3C-CF3<br><br><br>1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane<br><br>Freon 114, R-114, CFC-114, Dichlorotetrafluoroethane<br><br>3.8<br><br>ClF2C-CClF2<br><br><br>1,1-Dichloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane<br><br>CFC-114a, R-114a<br><br>3.4<br><br>Cl2FC-CF3<br><br><br>1-Chloro-1,1,2,2,2-pentafluoroethane<br><br>Freon 115, R-115, CFC-115, Chloropentafluoroethane<br><br>−38<br><br>ClF2C-CF3<br><br><br>2-Chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane<br><br>R-124, HCFC-124<br><br>−12<br><br>CHFClCF3<br><br><br>1,1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane<br><br>R-141b, HCFC-141b<br><br>32<br><br>Cl2FC-CH3<br><br><br>1-Chloro-1,1-difluoroethane<br><br>R-142b, HCFC-142b<br><br>−9.2<br><br>ClF2C-CH3<br><br><br>Tetrachloro-1,2-difluoroethane<br><br>Freon 112, R-112, CFC-112<br><br>91.5<br><br>CCl2FCCl2F<br><br><br>Tetrachloro-1,1-difluoroethane<br><br>Freon 112a, R-112a, CFC-112a<br><br>91.5<br><br>CClF2CCl3<br><br><br>1,1,2-Trichlorotrifluoroethane<br><br>Freon 113, R-113, CFC-113<br><br>48<br><br>CCl2FCClF2<br><br><br>1-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethane<br><br>Halon 2311a<br><br>51.7<br><br>CHClFCBrF2<br><br><br>2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane<br><br>Halon 2311<br><br>50.2<br><br>CF3CHBrCl<br><br><br>1,1-Dichloro-2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane<br><br>R-225ca, HCFC-225ca<br><br>51<br><br>CF3CF2CHCl2<br><br><br>1,3-Dichloro-1,2,2,3,3-pentafluoropropane<br><br>R-225cb, HCFC-225cb<br><br>56<br><br>CClF2CF2CHClF
