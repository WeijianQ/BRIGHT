## Original Question

*Are clouds a solid, liquid, or gas?

I have been looking online and they are often described ambiguously as a "mass". For instance, from NASA:

A cloud is a mass of water drops or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. Clouds form when water condenses in the sky. The condensation lets us see the water vapor. There are many different types of clouds. Clouds are an important part of Earth’s weather and climate.

Since they describe it as a vapor, that makes me think it is indeed a gas. But condensation is by definition the change of state from a gas to a liquid. So that makes it sound like it could be a liquid, or contain liquid droplets rather than "freely moving" molecules that typically make up a gas.

But at another web site, which doesn't seem all that authoritative, it says that clouds are a solid, liquid, and gas simultaneously!

A cloud is a liquid, a solid, and a gas.

That does seem intriguing. If I remember correctly, liquids are supposed to be incompressible, and clouds are likely compressible.*

The essential problem here is understanding the physical state of clouds. Clouds can indeed seem ambiguous because they exhibit characteristics of more than one state of matter. To address this, let's break down the components and behaviors of clouds, relating to the concepts of solids, liquids, and gases.

1. **Cloud Composition**: Clouds are primarily composed of tiny water droplets or ice crystals that are suspended in the atmosphere. The water droplets form when water vapor (a gas) in the air cools and condenses. This process is a transition from a gas to a liquid state. Ice crystals in clouds signify a solid state, forming when the temperature is below freezing.

2. **Physical States in Clouds**:
   - **Gas**: The water vapor present in the air before condensing into liquid droplets or freezing into ice crystals is in a gaseous state. This vapor is an essential component of cloud formation.
   - **Liquid**: The majority of clouds contain tiny liquid water droplets. These droplets form through condensation, which, as you correctly noted, is the process of a gas turning into a liquid. This transition happens when the air is cooled to its dew point, or when it becomes fully saturated with water vapor to the point it can't hold any more, leading to condensation.
   - **Solid**: In colder conditions, clouds contain ice crystals. These form when water vapor directly transitions from a gas to a solid (a process known as deposition), or when liquid droplets freeze. This gives clouds their solid component.

3. **Why Clouds Are Sometimes Described as All Three States**:
   - The statement that clouds can be considered a combination of solid, liquid, and gas simultaneously is rooted in their composition. Depending on the temperature and altitude, clouds can contain water in gas form (as vapor), liquid form (as droplets), and solid form (as ice crystals). The relative proportions of each state can vary greatly from one cloud to another.

4. **Compressibility and State of Matter**:
   - Your concern about liquids being incompressible and clouds being likely compressible touches on an interesting point. While it's true that liquids are relatively incompressible compared to gases, the compressibility of clouds as a whole is more about the air within and between the droplets and crystals than about the water particles themselves. Clouds can appear to expand or contract (behaviors associated with gases), but this is more about the movement and density of the air mixture they are part of, rather than the water droplets or ice crystals changing in volume significantly.

In conclusion, clouds are indeed a complex mixture that can contain elements of all three primary states of matter: solid (ice crystals), liquid (water droplets), and gas (water vapor). This unique combination allows them to exhibit properties of each state under different conditions, making them a fascinating subject of study in meteorology and atmospheric science.

> How are contrails different from other clouds?<br>Contrails are "human-induced" clouds since they are formed by water vapor condensing and freezing on particles from airplane exhaust. Contrails are always made of ice particles, due to the very cold temperatures at high altitude. Other types of clouds can be formed by water vapor that condenses on particles which are present in the atmosphere due to many sources, such as from volcanoes or dust storms, not specifically from aircraft exhaust. Those clouds are sometimes made of water droplets, and sometimes ice crystals, depending on the temperature where they form.

This phenomenon has since been referred to as the CLAW hypothesis, after the authors of the original study. A common CCN over oceans is sulphate aerosols. These aerosols are formed from the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) produced by algae found in seawater. Large algal blooms, observed to have increased in areas such as the South China Sea, can contribute a substantial amount of DMS into their surrounding atmospheres, leading to increased cloud formation. As the activity of phytoplankton is temperature reliant, this negative-feedback loop can act as a form of climate regulation.<br>The Revenge of Gaia, written by James Lovelock, an author of the 1987 study, proposes an alternative relationship between ocean temperatures and phytoplankton population size. This has been named the anti-CLAW hypothesis In this scenario, the stratification of oceans causes nutrient-rich cold water to become trapped under warmer water, where sunlight for photosynthesis is most abundant. This inhibits the growth of phytoplankton, resulting in the decrease in their population, and the sulfate CCNs they produce, with increasing temperature. This interaction thus lowers cloud albedo through decreasing CCN-induced cloud formations and increases the solar radiation allowed to reach ocean surfaces, resulting in a positive-feedback loop.<br>Volcanic ash and gas emissions from Alaska's Pavlof Volcano —NASA

The particles may be composed of dust or clay, soot or black carbon from grassland or forest fires, sea salt from ocean wave spray, soot from factory smokestacks or internal combustion engines, sulfate from volcanic activity, phytoplankton or the oxidation of sulfur dioxide and secondary organic matter formed by the oxidation of volatile organic compounds. The ability of these different types of particles to form cloud droplets varies according to their size and also their exact composition, as the hygroscopic properties of these different constituents are very different. Sulfate and sea salt, for instance, readily absorb water whereas soot, organic carbon, and mineral particles do not. This is made even more complicated by the fact that many of the chemical species may be mixed within the particles (in particular the sulfate and organic carbon).
