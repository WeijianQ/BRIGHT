# Query `54`

## Original Question

*Bohrmann et al. 1989 advanced the idea that the silicate phase from some clinoptilolites come from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal (from radiolarians in that case but presumably also other siliceous microfossils).

If this hypothesis is still regarded as valid, is clinoptilolite the only kind of authigenic zeolite that can be traced to biogenic opal?

Has any work been done in that domain since this paper?

To address the queries presented, let's break down the essential components and approach the problem step by step.

### Essential Problem

The core question revolves around the hypothesis proposed by Bohrmann et al. in 1989, suggesting that the silicate phase in some clinoptilolites originates from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal, specifically from radiolarians but potentially applicable to other siliceous microfossils as well. The inquiry seeks to understand whether this hypothesis remains valid and if clinoptilolite is the only type of authigenic zeolite that has been linked to biogenic opal. Additionally, it asks whether there has been further research in this domain since the publication of the 1989 paper.

### Step by Step Reasoning

1. **Validity of the 1989 Hypothesis**: To assess the current standing of the hypothesis proposed by Bohrmann et al., a review of recent literature and research in the field of geology, particularly studies focusing on zeolites, diagenesis, and biogenic opal, would be essential. This includes looking for papers that cite Bohrmann et al. 1989, to understand how subsequent research has built upon or refuted their findings.

2. **Clinoptilolite and Other Zeolites**: To determine whether clinoptilolite is the only type of authigenic zeolite linked to biogenic opal, an exploration of studies on the formation processes and sources of various authigenic zeolites is necessary. This involves examining research on the geochemical conditions under which different zeolites form and whether there are documented cases of other zeolites also originating from biogenic opal.

3. **Subsequent Research**: Identifying further work done in this domain since the 1989 paper involves a thorough search through scientific databases and journals for studies on the diagenetic transformation of biogenic opal into zeolites. This search should focus on keywords like "clinoptilolite," "biogenic opal," "authigenic zeolites," and "diagenesis," and should span from 1989 to the present to capture all relevant research.

### Draft Answer

Since the publication of Bohrmann et al.'s hypothesis in 1989, the scientific community has continued to explore the origins and formation processes of authigenic zeolites, including clinoptilolite. The hypothesis that clinoptilolite can form from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal has opened avenues for investigating the geochemical pathways through which siliceous microfossils contribute to the authigenic mineral phases in sedimentary environments.

To assess the current validity of this hypothesis, one would need to review recent geological literature, focusing on studies that have directly or indirectly tested or discussed the origins of clinoptilolite and other zeolites. While clinoptilolite has been a focal point due to its common occurrence and economic importance, research might have also uncovered evidence of other zeolites forming through similar processes. Indeed, the geochemical versatility and varying conditions under which zeolites can form suggest the possibility that other types might also originate from the diagenetic alteration of biogenic opal.

Furthermore, advancements in analytical techniques over the past decades, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and stable isotope analysis, have enhanced our ability to trace the origins and transformation processes of minerals in sedimentary environments. Such tools would be instrumental in identifying the specific pathways through which biogenic opal transitions into different zeolite minerals, including but not limited to clinoptilolite.

In summary, while the hypothesis by Bohrmann et al. remains a foundational piece in understanding the diagenetic processes leading to the formation of certain zeolites, the evolving nature of geological research suggests that there may now be a broader understanding of how biogenic opal contributes to the authigenic mineral inventory of sedimentary rocks. A detailed review of subsequent research would be required to fully answer the questions posed, considering both the advancements in scientific methodologies and the expansion of our knowledge base since 1989.

Corals form aragonitic<br>skeletons. Because of their seasonal growth bands and formation<br>near the sea surface, the isotopic and trace element compositions<br>of coral heads are important as recorders at high resolution<br>(decadal or longer) of late Quaternary sea level fluctuations, sea<br>surface paleo-temperatures, and rainfall data (i.e., refs. 33–36).<br>Another important mineral is celestite, which forms biogenically<br>by acantharians (zooplankton); however, its high solubility prevents its preservation as fossils. Despite the absence of celestite<br>from the geologic record, its importance lies in the influence on<br>recycling of Sr and Ba in the uppermost km of the ocean, with<br>important implications for chemical paleoceanographic interpretations of SryCa and BayCa ratios in corals and planktonic<br>foraminifera.<br>Fish-teeth apatite is highly useful for both stratigraphy and<br>chemical paleoceanography, especially in red clay deep-sea sediments where biogenic calcite and opal-A are absent because of<br>dissolution (37, 38).<br>Magnetite biomineralization first was identified in chiton teeth<br>(39), as it hardens their surface. The geologically important<br>magnetite consists of the morphologically distinct single domain<br>crystals formed by magnetotactic bacteria (39, 40). This magnetite is responsible for much of the stable magnetic remanence in<br>many marine sediments, which is valuable in paleomagnetic<br>studies.<br>Organic matter-rich sediments signify periods of higher productivity andyor higher organic C preservation in low-oxygen<br>waters, either in a more intense and expanded oxygen minimum<br>zone or in low-oxygen bottom waters (i.e., ref. 41). The assumed<br>link between organic C preservation and water oxygen content<br>has been challenged (i.e., ref. 42) and presently is being tested.<br>Nevertheless, the stable carbon isotopic composition of organic<br>matter in marine sediments helps to identify periods of high<br>productivity or of high terrestrial organic matter input from<br>enhanced continental weathering. This information is essential<br>for modeling the oceanic C cycle and atmospheric CO2 and O2<br>fluctuations (i.e., refs. 22, 43, and 44 and references therein).<br>Prime examples of periods with widely distributed organic C-rich<br>sediments are (a) the mid-Cretaceous abnormally organic C-rich<br>‘‘black’’ sediments in all major ocean basins, concentrated primarily in Aptian (115–110 Ma) and CenomanianyTuronian ('90<br>Ma) (i.e., refs. 45 and 46 and references therein), known as the<br>Crateceous Anoxic Events (CAE), and (b) the late Neogene<br>Mediterranean sapropels (i.e., ref. 47 and references therein).<br>The mid-Cretaceous organic C burial during the CAE has<br>significant implications for the ocean-atmosphere system C imbalance, as seen in the C isotopic composition of marine carbonates (48), hence on atmospheric O2 content. Such ‘‘black’’ shales<br>are potential reservoir rocks. Worldwide, Cretaceous strata are<br>known for being prolific hydrocarbon producers (i.e., refs. 49–51).<br>Authigenic Minerals. Authigenic minerals form by in situ<br>inorganic precipitation on the seafloor and within the sediment<br>column. Barite is the only mineral so far reported to also form in<br>the water column (52, 53). Some authigenic mineral reactions are<br>bacterially mediated; the bacteria modify the immediate geochemical environment, inducing mineral formation. For Paleoenvironmental studies, the most important marine authigenic<br>minerals are barite, francolite (a carbonate fluor apatite), evaporites, especially anhydriteygypsum and halite, and Mn-Feoxyhydroxide that occur as nodules or crusts. The concentrations<br>and isotopic compositions of oceanic conservative components in<br>these authigenic minerals that form at the seafloor are extremely<br>informative for studies of the history of seawater chemistry.<br>Nonconservative chemical components also reveal information<br>about distinct water masses, thus about ocean circulation in the<br>geologic past. In addition to diagenetic opal-CT and quartz that<br>form from the dissolution of biogenic opal-A, other common<br>authigenic alumino-silicate minerals are smectites and zeolites.<br>Dolomite and pyrite are also widespread authigenic minerals.<br>Authigenic alumino-silicates from both close to the sedimentseawater interface and the sediment column mainly form by<br>replacement of precursor minerals or mineraloids, but also can<br>form by direct precipitation from pore fluids. On short time scales<br>(decadal to millenial) the total amount of oceanic authigenic<br>silicate remineralization seems to exert an extremely small impact<br>on the global balance between CO2 degassing rate and atmospheric CO2 removal rate by continental weathering of silicates<br>(43, 54, 55). Research on the contribution of silicate remineralization to the global CO2 budget in the modern ocean presently<br>is being actively pursued (56).<br>The important marine clay minerals are smectites. The iron<br>smectite, nontronite, is widespread in the Pacific ocean floor<br>where hydrothermal activity is prevalent and sedimentation rates<br>are slow ,1 cmykyr. It forms at the seafloor from hydrothermal<br>Fe oxyhydroxides and opal-A (57). In addition, nontronite and<br>saponite replace precursor volcanic components, especially volcanic glass. Diagenetic illitic clays are celadonite and glauconite.<br>Celadonite is associated primarily with volcanic matter alteration.<br>Glauconite forms in subtropical and tropical margins in shallow<br>to intermediate water depths, near the sediment-water interface<br>beneath high productivity upwelling regions. These areas have<br>intermediate to slow sedimentation rates, and both ferric and<br>ferrous Fe are simultaneously available in pore waters. The<br>zeolite Phillipsite is common at the seafloor or at shallow burial<br>(58, 59). It replaces volcanic material in slow sedimentation<br>environments such as the South Pacific deep sea. Clinoptilolite is<br>also common and forms within the sediment column where silica<br>concentrations are elevated to stabilize it, mostly from opal-A<br>dissolution (59, 60). Occasionally clinoptilolite forms pseudomorphs after radiolaria tests (60). Analcime is significantly less<br>abundant and typically forms in volcanic ash-rich sediments (59).<br>Authigenic calcite is widespread in the ocean. It forms mostly<br>from biogenic calcite recyrstalization and is geochemically distinct in its minor and trace element concentrations from its<br>precursor. This recrystallization process ultimately transforms<br>calcareous ooze into chalk and limestone. Dolomite forms where<br>pore-fluid seawater is modified bacterially or by physicalchemical processes. In continental margins where pore fluids<br>become suboxic to anoxic, dolomite forms both as a primary<br>precipitate and by replacing precursor Ca and Ca-Mg carbonates<br>(61, 62). It also occurs in carbonate platforms where dolomite<br>replaces CaCO3 by the thermally driven convective flow of<br>seawater that is being inorganically and bacterially modified along<br>the flow path. The chemical and isotopic compositions, primarily<br>of carbon and oxygen, reveal the origins of the various dolomites.<br>Rhodochrosite and siderite are uncommon marine minerals.<br>Manganese and Fe mostly substitute for Mg in the dolomite<br>structure in suboxic to anoxic pore fluid environments where they<br>are mobilized. In these environments, only in the presence of<br>much detrital Mn and Fe, rhodochrosite andyor siderite may<br>form during late diagenesis where the reactions have driven<br>MgyCa ratios in the pore fluids to levels below dolomite stability.<br>Pyrite forms where sulfate is bacterially reduced. In these<br>environments Fe13 is reduced and mobilized, reacting with the<br>sulfide to form pyrite. Because of the large isotopic fractionation<br>by the bacterial reduction of sulfate to sulfide ('40%) the amount<br>of pyrite formation modulates the seawater-sulfate sulfur isotopic<br>composition and the atmospheric oxygen content, as discussed<br>below. Greigite, another Fe sulfide, may form kinetically instead<br>of pyrite, especially in the presence of Fe excess or in S-deficient<br>anoxic pore waters. The variability in pyrite versus greigite<br>formation reflects the pH and FeyS ratio of the pore fluid, which<br>originally was modified by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Greigite has<br>distinct magnetic properties.<br>The most important economic authigenic mineral is francolite,<br>which forms phosphorite deposits when tectonic-oceanographic<br>conditions are favorable (63, 64).

Oceanic phosphorites<br>form more than 80% of the world phosphate, whereas guano<br>deposits are considerably less economically important. Based on<br>recent research, francolite forms in continental margins at slow<br>to intermediate sedimentation rates and more efficiently in<br>suboxic to oxic bottom waters where Fe-redox cycling of P<br>prevails (64–66). Its occurrence in this environment is characteristic of high sea-level stands during interglacial periods, where<br>it is enriched by winnowing and redeposition during glacial<br>periods (67). Repeated formation and enrichment of this mineral<br>is necessary to form economic deposits. Secular variations in the<br>occurrence of large phosphorite deposits in the geologic record<br>reflect shifts in global regional patterns of P deposition that are<br>controlled by tectonics and climate. The chemical and isotopic<br>signatures in phosphorite francolite that forms at or close to the<br>sediment-seawater interface are those of the bottom water oceanic environment.

> part3 -------------------<br>Competing theories on geologic evolution[edit]<br>Over time, many theories have tried to clarify the evolution of the East African Rift. In 1972 it was proposed that the EAR was not caused by tectonic activity, but rather by differences in crustal density. Since the 1990s, evidence has been found in favor of mantle plumes beneath the EAR. Others proposed an African superplume causing mantle deformation. Although the effects of deep-rooted mantle plumes are an important hypothesis, their location and dynamics are poorly understood, and a matter of active research. The question is still debated.<br>The conceptual extensional difference between plume models and the superplume model placed beneath the East African Rift. Modified from Hansen et al. 2012.<br>Maps of four different depth slices of the Shear-velocity (Vs) model developed by Emry et al. 2018. The forms of the zones with lower Vs (colors toward red) suggest the hotter structures in the Mantle. The distinguishing fourth map depicts a depth below the 410 km discontinuity where Vs steeps up (getting overall bluer), but it still displays the signature of a plume at the substrate of the East African Rift. In the white box, the Vs vertical profile at 10°N, 40°E illustrates the increase of velocity with depth and the effect of the 410 km discontinuity.<br>The most recent and accepted view is the theory put forth in 2009: that magmatism and plate tectonics have a feedback with one another, controlled by oblique rifting conditions. According to this theory, lithospheric thinning generates volcanic activity, further increasing  magmatic processes such as intrusions and numerous small plumes. These processes further thin the lithosphere in saturated areas, making the thinning lithosphere behave like a mid-ocean ridge. According to marine geologist Kathleen Crane, the rift could eventually cause eastern Africa to separate from the mainland, although this potential event could take tens of millions of years.<br>Studies that contribute to the broader understanding on the evolution of rifts can be grouped into the techniques of isotope geochemistry, seismic tomography and geodynamical modeling.<br>Isotope geochemistry[edit]<br>The varying geochemical signatures of a suite of Ethiopian lavas suggest multiple plume sources: at least one of deep mantle origin, and one from within the subcontinental lithosphere. In accordance, a 2014 study compares the geochemical signature of rare earth isotopes from xenoliths and lava samples collected in the EAR. The results corroborate the coexistence of a superplume "common to the entire rift" with another mantle material source being either of subcontinental type or of mid-ocean ridge type.<br>Seismic tomography[edit]<br>The geophysical method of seismic tomography is a suitable tool to investigate Earth's subsurface structures deeper than the crust. It is an inverse problem technique that models which are the velocities of the inner Earth that reproduce the seismographic data recorded all around the world. Recent improvements of tomographic Earth models of P-wave and S-wave velocities suggest that a superplume upwelling from the lower mantle at the northeastern EAR feeds plumes of smaller scale into the upper mantle.<br>Geodynamical modeling[edit]<br>Parallel to geological and geophysical measures (e.g. isotope ratios and seismic velocities) it is constructive to test hypotheses on computer based geodynamical models. A 3D numerical geodynamic model of the plume-crust coupling was capable of reproducing the lateral asymmetry of the EAR around the Tanzania craton. Numerical modeling of plume-induced continental break-up shows two distinct stages, crustal rifting followed by lithospheric breakup, and the upwelling between stages of an upper mantle plume.

The iron<br>smectite, nontronite, is widespread in the Pacific ocean floor<br>where hydrothermal activity is prevalent and sedimentation rates<br>are slow ,1 cmykyr. It forms at the seafloor from hydrothermal<br>Fe oxyhydroxides and opal-A (57). In addition, nontronite and<br>saponite replace precursor volcanic components, especially volcanic glass. Diagenetic illitic clays are celadonite and glauconite.<br>Celadonite is associated primarily with volcanic matter alteration.<br>Glauconite forms in subtropical and tropical margins in shallow<br>to intermediate water depths, near the sediment-water interface<br>beneath high productivity upwelling regions. These areas have<br>intermediate to slow sedimentation rates, and both ferric and<br>ferrous Fe are simultaneously available in pore waters. The<br>zeolite Phillipsite is common at the seafloor or at shallow burial<br>(58, 59). It replaces volcanic material in slow sedimentation<br>environments such as the South Pacific deep sea. Clinoptilolite is<br>also common and forms within the sediment column where silica<br>concentrations are elevated to stabilize it, mostly from opal-A<br>dissolution (59, 60). Occasionally clinoptilolite forms pseudomorphs after radiolaria tests (60). Analcime is significantly less<br>abundant and typically forms in volcanic ash-rich sediments (59).<br>Authigenic calcite is widespread in the ocean. It forms mostly<br>from biogenic calcite recyrstalization and is geochemically distinct in its minor and trace element concentrations from its<br>precursor. This recrystallization process ultimately transforms<br>calcareous ooze into chalk and limestone. Dolomite forms where<br>pore-fluid seawater is modified bacterially or by physicalchemical processes. In continental margins where pore fluids<br>become suboxic to anoxic, dolomite forms both as a primary<br>precipitate and by replacing precursor Ca and Ca-Mg carbonates<br>(61, 62). It also occurs in carbonate platforms where dolomite<br>replaces CaCO3 by the thermally driven convective flow of<br>seawater that is being inorganically and bacterially modified along<br>the flow path. The chemical and isotopic compositions, primarily<br>of carbon and oxygen, reveal the origins of the various dolomites.<br>Rhodochrosite and siderite are uncommon marine minerals.<br>Manganese and Fe mostly substitute for Mg in the dolomite<br>structure in suboxic to anoxic pore fluid environments where they<br>are mobilized. In these environments, only in the presence of<br>much detrital Mn and Fe, rhodochrosite andyor siderite may<br>form during late diagenesis where the reactions have driven<br>MgyCa ratios in the pore fluids to levels below dolomite stability.<br>Pyrite forms where sulfate is bacterially reduced. In these<br>environments Fe13 is reduced and mobilized, reacting with the<br>sulfide to form pyrite. Because of the large isotopic fractionation<br>by the bacterial reduction of sulfate to sulfide ('40%) the amount<br>of pyrite formation modulates the seawater-sulfate sulfur isotopic<br>composition and the atmospheric oxygen content, as discussed<br>below. Greigite, another Fe sulfide, may form kinetically instead<br>of pyrite, especially in the presence of Fe excess or in S-deficient<br>anoxic pore waters. The variability in pyrite versus greigite<br>formation reflects the pH and FeyS ratio of the pore fluid, which<br>originally was modified by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Greigite has<br>distinct magnetic properties.<br>The most important economic authigenic mineral is francolite,<br>which forms phosphorite deposits when tectonic-oceanographic<br>conditions are favorable (63, 64). Similar to C, about 80% of the<br>global P burial occurs in continental margins despite the much<br>greater area of the deep ocean. Understanding the origin of<br>3382 Colloquium Paper: Kastner Proc.

Oceanic phosphorites<br>form more than 80% of the world phosphate, whereas guano<br>deposits are considerably less economically important. Based on<br>recent research, francolite forms in continental margins at slow<br>to intermediate sedimentation rates and more efficiently in<br>suboxic to oxic bottom waters where Fe-redox cycling of P<br>prevails (64–66). Its occurrence in this environment is characteristic of high sea-level stands during interglacial periods, where<br>it is enriched by winnowing and redeposition during glacial<br>periods (67). Repeated formation and enrichment of this mineral<br>is necessary to form economic deposits. Secular variations in the<br>occurrence of large phosphorite deposits in the geologic record<br>reflect shifts in global regional patterns of P deposition that are<br>controlled by tectonics and climate. The chemical and isotopic<br>signatures in phosphorite francolite that forms at or close to the<br>sediment-seawater interface are those of the bottom water oceanic environment. Because of slow formation and sedimentological reworking and mixing, the chemical paleoceanographic<br>information stored in phosphorite francolite, although extremely<br>valuable, is of moderate to low resolution.<br>Submarine Hydrothermal Sulfide Deposits. Submarine hydrothermal massive sulfide deposits forming at divergent plate<br>boundaries have been discovered only in the past '20 years.<br>These deposits primarily consist of the sulfides chalcopyrite,<br>sphalerite andyor wurtzite, pyrrhotite, pyrite andyor marcasite,<br>and the associated minerals anhydrite, barite, and opal-A. At the<br>seafloor in oxidizing low-temperature environments hydrothermal sulfides are unstable, they are oxidized to form Fe oxides and<br>secondary sulfides such as covellite, digenite, and bornite, except<br>if rapidly covered by new volcanic eruptions (i.e., refs. 68 and 69).<br>As yet, observations mainly of surface seafloor sites have been<br>conducted, and the magnitude and structures of these sulfide<br>deposits have not yet been thoroughly characterized. The discovery of massive sulfide deposits has had a profound impact on our<br>understanding of ore-forming processes, but their economic<br>significance is still uncertain.<br>At fast- and slow-spreading centers, seawater penetrates several km into oceanic basement (maximum depth is above the top<br>of the magma chamber), where it is heated to 350–400°C and<br>interacts with oceanic basement and sediments. This fluid ascends by buoyancy to form hydrothermal vents and sulfide
