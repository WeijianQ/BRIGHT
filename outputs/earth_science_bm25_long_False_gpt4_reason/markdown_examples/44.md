# Query `44`

## Original Question

*I thought Auroras are only visible in the North Pole and South Pole, but recently, I found out that Auroras can be seen in areas of the world closer to the equator.

An example is that in the year 1909, a great storm of Auroras were seen in Japan and other countries.

This made me wonder: could an Aurora be seen in equatorial regions, too?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is understanding whether Auroras can be seen in equatorial regions, despite the common belief that they are primarily visible near the polar regions (the North and South Poles). To address this, we need to explore the science behind Auroras, historical instances of their appearance at lower latitudes, and the conditions that could make such phenomena possible closer to the equator.

### Understanding Auroras

1. **What are Auroras?**
   - Auroras are natural light displays in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions around the Arctic and Antarctic. They are caused by disturbances in the magnetosphere by the solar wind. These disturbances are usually more intense during solar maxima.

2. **How do Auroras form?**
   - The process begins with the emission of particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind. When these charged particles reach Earth, they are deflected by the Earth's magnetic field. However, some particles enter the Earth's magnetosphere, colliding with gas atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere, causing them to light up and create the auroral display.

### Historical Instances of Auroras at Lower Latitudes

1. **The 1909 event and others**
   - You mentioned the 1909 event when Auroras were observed in Japan and other countries further from the poles. This is not an isolated instance; throughout history, there have been several reports of auroral sightings at lower latitudes. These events are often associated with strong solar storms that produce a significant increase in solar wind intensity and geomagnetic activity, allowing Auroras to be seen much further from the poles than usual.

### Conditions for Equatorial Auroras

1. **Intensity of Solar Activity**
   - For an Aurora to be seen near the equator, an extremely strong solar storm is required, one that greatly enhances the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere. Such storms are rare but have occurred in historical records.

2. **Geomagnetic Latitude vs. Geographic Latitude**
   - It's important to differentiate between geomagnetic and geographic latitudes. The Earth's geomagnetic poles, which influence where Auroras occur, do not align perfectly with the geographic poles. This discrepancy means that Auroras can appear at different geographic latitudes under intense solar activity.

3. **Historical Precedence**
   - There have been instances, though rare, where Auroras were reported close to the equator. The Carrington Event of 1859 is one notable example, where Auroras were reported as far south as the Caribbean.

### Conclusion

While it's uncommon, the possibility of witnessing an Aurora near equatorial regions exists but requires exceptionally strong solar storms. These conditions disrupt the Earth's magnetosphere to a degree that allows charged particles to penetrate deeper into the atmosphere and closer to the equator than under normal circumstances. However, such events are rare and unpredictable, making Auroras primarily a high-latitude phenomenon but not exclusively so.

> the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone.<br>Moon and aurora<br>Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance

> part1 -------------------<br><br>An aurora (pl. aurorae or auroras),<br>also commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.<br>Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.<br>Most of the planets in the Solar System, some natural satellites, brown dwarfs, and even comets also host auroras.

> Associated solar flare[edit]<br>Just before noon on 1 September 1859, the English amateur astronomers Richard Christopher Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently recorded the earliest observations of a solar flare.[8] Carrington and Hodgson compiled independent reports which were published side by side in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and exhibited their drawings of the event at the November 1859 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.[9][10]<br>Because of a geomagnetic solar flare effect (a "magnetic crochet")[11] observed in the Kew Observatory magnetometer record by Scottish physicist Balfour Stewart, and a geomagnetic storm observed the following day, Carrington suspected a solar-terrestrial connection.[12] Worldwide reports of the effects of the geomagnetic storm of 1859 were compiled and published by American mathematician Elias Loomis, which support the observations of Carrington and Stewart.[13]<br><br>Impact[edit]<br>Auroras[edit]<br>Aurora during a geomagnetic storm that was most likely caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun on 24 May 2010, taken from the International Space Station<br>Auroras were seen around the world in both northern and southern hemispheres. The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning.[8] People in the northeastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light.[14] The aurora was visible from the poles to low latitude areas such as south-central Mexico,[15][16] Cuba, Hawaii, Queensland,[17] southern Japan and China,[18] and even at lower latitudes very close to the equator, such as in Colombia.[19]<br>On Saturday 3 September 1859, the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported:<br><br>Those who happened to be out late on Thursday night had an opportunity of witnessing another magnificent display of the auroral lights. The phenomenon was very similar to the display on Sunday night, though at times the light was, if possible, more brilliant, and the prismatic hues more varied and gorgeous. The light appeared to cover the whole firmament, apparently like a luminous cloud, through which the stars of the larger magnitude indistinctly shone. The light was greater than that of the moon at its full, but had an indescribable softness and delicacy that seemed to envelop everything upon which it rested. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, when the display was at its full brilliancy, the quiet streets of the city resting under this strange light, presented a beautiful as well as singular appearance.[20]<br><br>In 1909, an Australian gold miner named C F Herbert retold his observations in a letter to the Daily News in Perth:<br><br><br>I was gold-digging at Rokewood, about four miles [6 km] from Rokewood township (Victoria). Myself and two mates looking out of the tent saw a great reflection in the southern heavens at about 7 o'clock p.m., and in about half an hour, a scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself:<br>Lights of every imaginable color were issuing from the southern heavens, one color fading away only to give place to another if possible more beautiful than the last, the streams mounting to the zenith, but always becoming a rich purple when reaching there, and always curling round, leaving a clear strip of sky, which may be described as four fingers held at arm's length.<br>The northern side from the zenith was also illuminated with beautiful colors, always curling round at the zenith, but were considered to be merely a reproduction of the southern display, as all colors south and north always corresponded.<br>It was a sight never to be forgotten, and was considered at the time to be the greatest aurora recorded [...]. The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes, recognising, the divine immanence, immutable law, cause, and effect. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.[21]<br><br><br>Telegraphs[edit]<br>Because of the geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field, telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving their operators electric shocks.[22] Telegraph pylons threw sparks.[23] Some operators were able to continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies.[24][25] The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American telegraph line between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Evening Traveler:Boston operator (to Portland operator): "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."<br>Portland operator: "Will do so. It is now disconnected."<br>Boston: "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"<br>Portland: "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."<br>Boston: "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."<br>Portland: "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"<br><br>Boston: "Yes. Go ahead."The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.[26]<br>Similar events[edit]<br>See also: List of solar storms<br>Another strong solar storm occurred in February 1872.[27]  Less severe storms also occurred in 1921 (this was comparable by some measures), when widespread radio disruption was reported. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm knocked out power across large sections of Quebec. On 23 July 2012, a "Carrington-class" solar superstorm (solar flare, CME, solar electromagnetic pulse) was observed, but its trajectory narrowly missed Earth.[5][28]<br>In June 2013, a joint venture from researchers at Lloyd's of London and Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) in the US used data from the Carrington Event to estimate the cost of a similar event in the present to the US alone at US$600 billion to $2.6 trillion (equivalent to $774 billion to $3.35 trillion in 2023[29]),[3] which, at the time, equated to roughly 3.6 to 15.5 percent of annual GDP.<br>Other research has looked for signatures of large solar flares and CMEs in carbon-14 in tree rings and beryllium-10 (among other isotopes) in ice cores. The signature of a large solar storm has been found for the years 774–775 and 993–994.[30][31] Carbon-14 levels stored in 775 suggest an event about 20 times the normal variation of the sun's activity, and 10 or more times the size of the Carrington Event.[32] An event in 7176 BCE may have exceeded even the 774–775 event based on this proxy data.[33]<br>Whether the physics of solar flares is similar to that of even larger superflares is still unclear. The sun may differ in important ways such as size and speed of rotation from the types of stars that are known to produce superflares.[31]<br><br>Other evidence[edit]<br>Ice cores containing thin nitrate-rich layers have been analysed to reconstruct a history of past solar storms predating reliable observations. This was based on the hypothesis that solar energetic particles would ionize nitrogen, leading to the production of nitric oxide and other oxidised nitrogen compounds, which would not be too diluted in the atmosphere before being deposited along with snow.[34]<br>Beginning in 1986, some researchers claimed that data from Greenland ice cores showed evidence of individual solar particle events, including the Carrington Event.[35] More recent ice core work, however, casts significant doubt on this interpretation and shows that nitrate spikes are likely not a result of solar energetic particle events but can be due to terrestrial events such as forest fires, and correlate with other chemical signatures of known forest fire plumes. Nitrate events in cores from Greenland and Antarctica do not align, so the hypothesis that they reflect proton events is now in significant doubt.[34][36][37]<br>A 2024 study analysed digitized magnetogram readings from magnetic observatories at Kew and Greenwich. "Initial analysis suggests the rates of change of the field of over 700 nT/min exceeded the 1-in-100 years extreme value of 350–400 nT/min at this latitude based on digital-era records,"[38] indicating a far greater change rate than modern digital measurements.[39]<br><br>See also[edit]<br>A-index<br>COBRA, 2020 British TV series imagining an equivalent storm affecting contemporary Great Britain<br>K-index<br>Nuclear electromagnetic pulse<br>774–775 carbon-14 spike<br>Miyake event<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ Kimball, D.

It created strong auroral displays that were reported globally[1] and caused sparking and even fires in multiple telegraph stations. The geomagnetic storm was most likely the result of a coronal mass ejection (CME) from the Sun colliding with Earth's magnetosphere.[2]<br>The geomagnetic storm was associated with a very bright solar flare on 1 September 1859. It was observed and recorded independently by British astronomers Richard Christopher Carrington and Richard Hodgson—the first records of a solar flare.<br>A geomagnetic storm of this magnitude occurring today would cause widespread electrical disruptions, blackouts, and damage due to extended outages of the electrical power grid.[3][4][5]<br><br><br>History[edit]<br>Geomagnetic storm[edit]<br>The July 2012 solar storm, as photographed by STEREO, was a CME of comparable strength to the one which is thought to have struck the Earth during the 1859 Carrington Event.<br>On 1 and 2 September 1859, one of the largest geomagnetic storms (as recorded by ground-based magnetometers) occurred.[6] Estimates of the storm strength (Dst) range from −0.80 to −1.75 µT.[7]<br>The geomagnetic storm is thought to have been initiated by a major CME that traveled directly toward Earth, taking 17.6 hours to make the 150-million-kilometre (93-million-mile) journey. Typical CMEs take several days to arrive at Earth, but it is believed that the relatively high speed of this CME was made possible by a prior CME, perhaps the cause of the large aurora event on 29 August that "cleared the way" of ambient solar wind plasma for the Carrington Event.[8]

> Associated solar flare[edit]<br>Just before noon on 1 September 1859, the English amateur astronomers Richard Christopher Carrington and Richard Hodgson independently recorded the earliest observations of a solar flare.[8] Carrington and Hodgson compiled independent reports which were published side by side in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and exhibited their drawings of the event at the November 1859 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society.[9][10]<br>Because of a geomagnetic solar flare effect (a "magnetic crochet")[11] observed in the Kew Observatory magnetometer record by Scottish physicist Balfour Stewart, and a geomagnetic storm observed the following day, Carrington suspected a solar-terrestrial connection.[12] Worldwide reports of the effects of the geomagnetic storm of 1859 were compiled and published by American mathematician Elias Loomis, which support the observations of Carrington and Stewart.[13]<br><br>Impact[edit]<br>Auroras[edit]<br>Aurora during a geomagnetic storm that was most likely caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun on 24 May 2010, taken from the International Space Station<br>Auroras were seen around the world in both northern and southern hemispheres. The aurora over the Rocky Mountains in the United States was so bright that the glow woke gold miners, who began preparing breakfast because they thought it was morning.[8] People in the northeastern United States could read a newspaper by the aurora's light.[14] The aurora was visible from the poles to low latitude areas such as south-central Mexico,[15][16] Cuba, Hawaii, Queensland,[17] southern Japan and China,[18] and even at lower latitudes very close to the equator, such as in Colombia.[19]<br>On Saturday 3 September 1859, the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported:<br><br>Those who happened to be out late on Thursday night had an opportunity of witnessing another magnificent display of the auroral lights. The phenomenon was very similar to the display on Sunday night, though at times the light was, if possible, more brilliant, and the prismatic hues more varied and gorgeous. The light appeared to cover the whole firmament, apparently like a luminous cloud, through which the stars of the larger magnitude indistinctly shone. The light was greater than that of the moon at its full, but had an indescribable softness and delicacy that seemed to envelop everything upon which it rested. Between 12 and 1 o'clock, when the display was at its full brilliancy, the quiet streets of the city resting under this strange light, presented a beautiful as well as singular appearance.[20]<br><br>In 1909, an Australian gold miner named C F Herbert retold his observations in a letter to the Daily News in Perth:<br><br><br>I was gold-digging at Rokewood, about four miles [6 km] from Rokewood township (Victoria). Myself and two mates looking out of the tent saw a great reflection in the southern heavens at about 7 o'clock p.m., and in about half an hour, a scene of almost unspeakable beauty presented itself:<br>Lights of every imaginable color were issuing from the southern heavens, one color fading away only to give place to another if possible more beautiful than the last, the streams mounting to the zenith, but always becoming a rich purple when reaching there, and always curling round, leaving a clear strip of sky, which may be described as four fingers held at arm's length.<br>The northern side from the zenith was also illuminated with beautiful colors, always curling round at the zenith, but were considered to be merely a reproduction of the southern display, as all colors south and north always corresponded.<br>It was a sight never to be forgotten, and was considered at the time to be the greatest aurora recorded [...]. The rationalist and pantheist saw nature in her most exquisite robes, recognising, the divine immanence, immutable law, cause, and effect. The superstitious and the fanatical had dire forebodings, and thought it a foreshadowing of Armageddon and final dissolution.[21]<br><br><br>Telegraphs[edit]<br>Because of the geomagnetically induced current from the electromagnetic field, telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases giving their operators electric shocks.[22] Telegraph pylons threw sparks.[23] Some operators were able to continue to send and receive messages despite having disconnected their power supplies.[24][25] The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American telegraph line between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine, on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the Boston Evening Traveler:Boston operator (to Portland operator): "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."<br>Portland operator: "Will do so. It is now disconnected."<br>Boston: "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"<br>Portland: "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."<br>Boston: "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."<br>Portland: "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"<br><br>Boston: "Yes. Go ahead."The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no battery power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.[26]<br>Similar events[edit]<br>See also: List of solar storms<br>Another strong solar storm occurred in February 1872.[27]  Less severe storms also occurred in 1921 (this was comparable by some measures), when widespread radio disruption was reported. The March 1989 geomagnetic storm knocked out power across large sections of Quebec. On 23 July 2012, a "Carrington-class" solar superstorm (solar flare, CME, solar electromagnetic pulse) was observed, but its trajectory narrowly missed Earth.[5][28]<br>In June 2013, a joint venture from researchers at Lloyd's of London and Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER) in the US used data from the Carrington Event to estimate the cost of a similar event in the present to the US alone at US$600 billion to $2.6 trillion (equivalent to $774 billion to $3.35 trillion in 2023[29]),[3] which, at the time, equated to roughly 3.6 to 15.5 percent of annual GDP.<br>Other research has looked for signatures of large solar flares and CMEs in carbon-14 in tree rings and beryllium-10 (among other isotopes) in ice cores. The signature of a large solar storm has been found for the years 774–775 and 993–994.[30][31] Carbon-14 levels stored in 775 suggest an event about 20 times the normal variation of the sun's activity, and 10 or more times the size of the Carrington Event.[32] An event in 7176 BCE may have exceeded even the 774–775 event based on this proxy data.[33]<br>Whether the physics of solar flares is similar to that of even larger superflares is still unclear. The sun may differ in important ways such as size and speed of rotation from the types of stars that are known to produce superflares.[31]<br><br>Other evidence[edit]<br>Ice cores containing thin nitrate-rich layers have been analysed to reconstruct a history of past solar storms predating reliable observations. This was based on the hypothesis that solar energetic particles would ionize nitrogen, leading to the production of nitric oxide and other oxidised nitrogen compounds, which would not be too diluted in the atmosphere before being deposited along with snow.[34]<br>Beginning in 1986, some researchers claimed that data from Greenland ice cores showed evidence of individual solar particle events, including the Carrington Event.[35] More recent ice core work, however, casts significant doubt on this interpretation and shows that nitrate spikes are likely not a result of solar energetic particle events but can be due to terrestrial events such as forest fires, and correlate with other chemical signatures of known forest fire plumes. Nitrate events in cores from Greenland and Antarctica do not align, so the hypothesis that they reflect proton events is now in significant doubt.[34][36][37]<br>A 2024 study analysed digitized magnetogram readings from magnetic observatories at Kew and Greenwich. "Initial analysis suggests the rates of change of the field of over 700 nT/min exceeded the 1-in-100 years extreme value of 350–400 nT/min at this latitude based on digital-era records,"[38] indicating a far greater change rate than modern digital measurements.[39]<br><br>See also[edit]<br>A-index<br>COBRA, 2020 British TV series imagining an equivalent storm affecting contemporary Great Britain<br>K-index<br>Nuclear electromagnetic pulse<br>774–775 carbon-14 spike<br>Miyake event<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ Kimball, D.
