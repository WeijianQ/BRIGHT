# Query `85`

## Original Question

*For my research related to coastal Odisha, India I am mapping the coastal boundary. I have downloaded available Landsat images which date back to 1972. But I want to map the same for before 1972.

I am interested in old topographic maps showing the coastal boundary of Odisha, preferably before 1970.

Does anyone know from where can I get the scanned map of the same?*

The essential problem you're facing is locating and accessing scanned versions of old topographic maps of the coastal boundary of Odisha, India, specifically from before 1970. Here's a step-by-step approach to address this problem:

### 1. Identify Potential Sources for Historical Maps
To find these maps, you'll need to explore several potential sources that specialize in historical or archival materials. These sources include:

- **National Archives of India**: They house an extensive collection of historical documents and maps. It's possible they have digital scans or physical copies of the maps you're seeking.
- **Survey of India**: As the central engineering agency in charge of mapping and surveying, the Survey of India holds a vast archive of maps. While access to some materials might be restricted, they could have the historical topographic maps of the Odisha coast.
- **University Libraries and Archives**: Universities with strong geography or history departments, such as the University of Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University, or Utkal University in Odisha, might have collections of old maps or can guide you to specific archives.
- **International Libraries and Archives**: Libraries such as the British Library or the Library of Congress in the USA have significant collections of maps from around the world, including India. They might have digitized their collections, which could include the maps you're interested in.
- **Online Digital Map Collections**: Websites like Old Maps Online or the David Rumsey Map Collection aggregate digital copies of maps from various libraries and archives, making them a valuable resource for historical maps.

### 2. Searching and Requesting Maps
Once you've identified potential sources, the next steps involve searching their catalogs and, if necessary, requesting access:

- **Catalog Searches**: Start by searching the online catalogs of these institutions using specific keywords such as "Odisha coast," "topographic maps Odisha," and "historical maps Odisha" with the year range you're interested in.
- **Contacting Institutions**: If online searches do not yield results, directly contact the institutions. Explain your research and specify what you're looking for. Some archives might require formal requests or letters of introduction.
- **Digital Libraries and Platforms**: For digital collections, use their search functions with various keywords and filters related to the geographical area and time period of interest.

### 3. Utilizing Academic Networks
If direct searches don’t lead to the desired outcomes, leveraging academic networks can be invaluable:

- **Reach out to Academics**: Contact scholars who have worked on similar topics or who have expertise in the geography or history of Odisha. They might have personal collections or know where to find these maps.
- **Forums and Groups**: Engage with online forums, social media groups, or mailing lists related to historical geography, Indian history, or cartography. Members of these communities can offer leads or share personal collections.

### 4. Consider Alternatives
If exact maps from before 1970 are not available, consider using slightly later maps or related geographical literature that might describe the coastal boundaries and significant changes over time. This information can sometimes help in extrapolating or understanding earlier coastal conditions.

### Final Thoughts
Finding specific historical maps can be challenging, requiring patience and persistence. However, by methodically exploring these avenues and leveraging both digital and academic networks, you stand a good chance of locating the topographic maps of the Odisha coast before 1970. Remember, even if direct access to digital scans is not possible, institutions might allow you to view or photograph maps for research purposes under certain conditions.

The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology). It also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.<br>In current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into "active" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection is detected by the sensor) and "passive" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor).[1][2][3][4]<br><br><br>Overview[edit]<br>This video is about how Landsat was used to identify areas of conservation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and how it was used to help map an area called MLW in the north.<br>Remote sensing can be divided into two types of methods: Passive remote sensing and Active remote sensing. Passive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film photography, infrared, charge-coupled devices, and radiometers. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. RADAR and LiDAR are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, speed and direction of an object.<br><br>Illustration of remote sensing<br>Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the Amazon Basin, glacial features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the Cold War made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.<br>Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as El Niño and other natural long and short term phenomena.

Other types of active collection includes plasmas in the ionosphere. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar is used to produce precise digital elevation models of large scale terrain (See RADARSAT, TerraSAR-X, Magellan).<br>Laser and radar altimeters on satellites have provided a wide range of data. By measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity, they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so.

Vegetation remote sensing is a principal application of LIDAR.[10]<br>Radiometers and photometers are the most common instrument in use, collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave, gamma-ray, and rarely, ultraviolet. They may also be used to detect the emission spectra of various chemicals, providing data on chemical concentrations in the atmosphere.<br>Examples of remote sensing equipment deployed byor interfaced with oceanographic research vessels.[11]<br>Radiometers are also used at night, because artificial light emissions are a key signature of human activity.[12] Applications include remote sensing of population, GDP, and damage to infrastructure from war or disasters.<br>Radiometers and radar onboard of satellites can be used to monitor volcanic eruptions [13][14]<br>Spectropolarimetric Imaging has been reported to be useful for target tracking purposes by researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. They determined that manmade items possess polarimetric signatures that are not found in natural objects. These conclusions were drawn from the imaging of military trucks, like the Humvee, and trailers with their acousto-optic tunable filter dual hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric VNIR Spectropolarimetric Imager.[15][16]<br>Stereographic pairs of aerial photographs have often been used to make topographic maps by imagery and terrain analysts in trafficability and highway departments for potential routes, in addition to modelling terrestrial habitat features.[17][18][19]<br>Simultaneous multi-spectral platforms such as Landsat have been in use since the 1970s. These thematic mappers take images in multiple wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (multi-spectral) and are usually found on Earth observation satellites, including (for example) the Landsat program or the IKONOS satellite. Maps of land cover and land use from thematic mapping can be used to prospect for minerals, detect or monitor land usage, detect invasive vegetation, deforestation, and examine the health of indigenous plants and crops (satellite crop monitoring), including entire farming regions or forests.[20] Prominent scientists using remote sensing for this purpose include Janet Franklin and Ruth DeFries. Landsat images are used by regulatory agencies such as KYDOW to indicate water quality parameters including Secchi depth, chlorophyll density, and total phosphorus content. Weather satellites are used in meteorology and climatology.<br>Hyperspectral imaging produces an image where each pixel has full spectral information with imaging narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range. Hyperspectral imagers are used in various applications including mineralogy, biology, defence, and environmental measurements.<br>Within the scope of the combat against desertification, remote sensing allows researchers to follow up and monitor risk areas in the long term, to determine desertification factors, to support decision-makers in defining relevant measures of environmental management, and to assess their impacts.[21]<br>Remotely sensed multi- and hyperspectral images can be used for assessing biodiversity at different scales. Since the spectral properties of different plants species are unique, it is possible to get information about properties that relates to biodiversity such as habitat heterogeneity, spectral diversity and plant functional trait.[22][23][24]<br>Remote sensing has been used to detect rare plants to aid in conservation efforts.

Overhead gravity data collection was first used in aerial submarine detection. This data revealed minute perturbations in the Earth's gravitational field that may be used to determine changes in the mass distribution of the Earth, which in turn may be used for geophysical studies, as in GRACE. Geometric remote sensing includes position and deformation imaging using InSAR, LIDAR, etc.[27]<br>Acoustic and near-acoustic[edit]<br>Sonar: passive sonar, listening for the sound made by another object (a vessel, a whale etc.); active sonar, emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes, used for detecting, ranging and measurements of underwater objects and terrain.<br>Seismograms taken at different locations can locate and measure earthquakes (after they occur) by comparing the relative intensity and precise timings.<br>Ultrasound: Ultrasound sensors, that emit high-frequency pulses and listening for echoes, used for detecting water waves and water level, as in tide gauges or for towing tanks.<br>To coordinate a series of large-scale observations, most sensing systems depend on the following: platform location and the orientation of the sensor. High-end instruments now often use positional information from satellite navigation systems. The rotation and orientation are often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses. Compasses can measure not just azimuth (i. e. degrees to magnetic north), but also altitude (degrees above the horizon), since the magnetic field curves into the Earth at different angles at different latitudes. More exact orientations require gyroscopic-aided orientation, periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks.<br><br>Data characteristics[edit]<br>The quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal resolutions.<br><br>Spatial resolution<br>The size of a pixel that is recorded in a raster image – typically pixels may correspond to square areas ranging in side length from 1 to 1,000 metres (3.3 to 3,280.8 ft).<br>Spectral resolution<br>The wavelength of the different frequency bands recorded – usually, this is related to the number of frequency bands recorded by the platform. Current Landsat collection is that of seven bands, including several in the infrared spectrum, ranging from a spectral resolution of 0.7 to 2.1 μm.

This depends on the type of sensor used. For example, in conventional photographs, distances are accurate in the center of the image, with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center. Another factor is that of the platen against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances. The step in which this problem is resolved is called georeferencing and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image (typically 30 or more points per image) which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark, "warping" the image to produce accurate spatial data. As of the early 1990s, most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced.<br>In addition, images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected.<br><br>Radiometric correction<br>Allows avoidance of radiometric errors and distortions. The illumination of objects on the Earth's surface is uneven because of different properties of the relief. This factor is taken into account in the method of radiometric distortion correction.[28] Radiometric correction gives a scale to the pixel values, e. g. the monochromatic scale of 0 to 255 will be converted to actual radiance values.<br>Topographic correction (also called terrain correction)<br>In rugged mountains, as a result of terrain, the effective illumination of pixels varies considerably. In a remote sensing image, the pixel on the shady slope receives weak illumination and has a low radiance value, in contrast, the pixel on the sunny slope receives strong illumination and has a high radiance value. For the same object, the pixel radiance value on the shady slope will be different from that on the sunny slope. Additionally, different objects may have similar radiance values. These ambiguities seriously affected remote sensing image information extraction accuracy in mountainous areas. It became the main obstacle to the further application of remote sensing images. The purpose of topographic correction is to eliminate this effect, recovering the true reflectivity or radiance of objects in horizontal conditions.

The first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process; spatial measurement through the use of a light table in both conventional single or stereographic coverage, added skills such as the use of photogrammetry, the use of photomosaics, repeat coverage, Making use of objects' known dimensions in order to detect modifications.

At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with lossless compression. The difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche, usually in typefonts such as OCR-B, or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.
