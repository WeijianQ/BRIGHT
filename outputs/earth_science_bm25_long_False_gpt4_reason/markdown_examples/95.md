# Query `95`

## Original Question

*According to this article from 2015 How much oil is left on Earth

1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil reserves were left in the world by end 2015

But how much oil was already consumed worldwide since it was started to use massively in the mid 19th century? Is it most of it or a small part of it?

PS: I'm not sure if this question is for Earth Science SE or for Economy SE, if you think it's in the wrong SE please move it.*

The essential problem you're addressing is determining how much of the world's total original oil reserves have been consumed since oil began to be used on a massive scale in the mid-19th century, up to the point mentioned in the 2015 article which states that 1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil reserves were left. To analyze this, we need to consider several factors and steps:

1. **Historical Oil Consumption Data**: The first step is to gather data on global oil consumption from the mid-19th century to 2015. This data would likely be measured in barrels per year and would show how consumption has increased over time, especially during periods of industrial growth and expansion of the automotive industry.

2. **Total Oil Reserves at the Start**: It would be crucial to estimate or find historical estimates of the total amount of oil reserves that were believed to be in the Earth before we started using it massively. This figure is challenging to pinpoint due to the changing nature of what is considered "recoverable" oil with technological advances.

3. **Advancements in Oil Recovery Technology**: Over time, advancements in technology have made it possible to extract oil from previously inaccessible or uneconomical sources. This means that the total recoverable oil reserves can increase, even as we consume oil, complicating the calculation.

4. **Alternative and Unconventional Sources**: Including the contribution of unconventional oil sources like tar sands, oil shale, and deep-water drilling areas, which have become more significant in recent years, is also important. These sources have added to the total recoverable reserves and have been exploited increasingly over the past few decades.

5. **Annual Reports and Statistical Data**: Examining annual reports from organizations like the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), and OPEC can provide detailed statistics on yearly consumption rates, discoveries of new oil fields, and revisions of estimated recoverable reserves.

To directly address your question, if we consider the massive usage of oil to have started in the mid-19th century, we need to account for the total consumption from that point to 2015. This would involve summing up the annual global consumption rates. While it's challenging to provide an exact figure without access to all the detailed annual data, it's widely recognized that the rate of consumption has accelerated dramatically over the past century. Given the information that 1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil reserves were left by the end of 2015, and considering the technological advancements that have allowed us to continuously find and exploit new oil reserves, it's reasonable to infer that humanity has consumed a significant portion, but not most, of the total original oil reserves. This is because the definition of "recoverable reserves" expands with technological and economic changes, and new reserves are continuously being discovered, albeit at potentially diminishing rates.

In conclusion, while a precise figure would require extensive data compilation and analysis, it's clear that a significant amount of the Earth's original oil reserves has been consumed since the mid-19th century. However, due to technological advances and the discovery of new reserves, it's difficult to quantify this as "most" of the oil without a clear understanding of the total original reserves and the continuously evolving nature of what constitutes recoverable oil.

> part6 -------------------<br>Estimating reserves[edit]<br><br>Main article: Oil & gas reserves and resource quantification<br>After the discovery of a reservoir, a petroleum engineer will seek to build a better picture of the accumulation. In a simple textbook example of a uniform reservoir, the first stage is to conduct a seismic survey to determine the possible size of the trap. Appraisal wells can be used to determine the location of oil-water contact and with it the height of the oil bearing sands. Often coupled with seismic data, it is possible to estimate the volume of an oil-bearing reservoir.<br>The next step is to use information from appraisal wells to estimate the porosity of the rock. The porosity of an oil field, or the percentage of the total volume that contains fluids rather than solid rock, is 20–35% or less. It can give information on the actual capacity. Laboratory testing can determine the characteristics of the reservoir fluids, particularly the expansion factor of the oil, or how much the oil expands when brought from the high pressure and high temperature of the reservoir to a "stock tank" at the surface.<br>With such information, it is possible to estimate how many "stock tank" barrels of oil are located in the reservoir. Such oil is called the stock tank oil initially in place. As a result of studying factors such as the permeability of the rock (how easily fluids can flow through the rock) and possible drive mechanisms, it is possible to estimate the recovery factor, or what proportion of oil in place can be reasonably expected to be produced. The recovery factor is commonly 30–35%, giving a value for the recoverable resources.<br>The difficulty is that reservoirs are not uniform. They have variable porosities and permeabilities and may be compartmentalized, with fractures and faults breaking them up and complicating fluid flow. For this reason, computer modeling of economically viable reservoirs is often carried out. Geologists, geophysicists, and reservoir engineers work together to build a model that allows simulation of the flow of fluids in the reservoir, leading to an improved estimate of the recoverable resources.<br>Reserves are only the part of those recoverable resources that will be developed through identified and approved development projects. Because the evaluation of reserves has a direct impact on the company or the asset value, it usually follows a strict set of rules or guidelines.

It’s common to hear that electric vehicles are going to take over the motor vehicle market sometime soon and eliminate much of the demand for oil in the not-too-distant future.</p<br><pIn spite of those claims, which have been made for some years now, global oil consumption has risen at a rate of nearly 1 million barrels/day (mb/d) per year on average from 2000 to 2017.&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration (US DOE/EIA or EIA) is predicting that global petroleum consumption (this includes all hydrocarbon liquids) will increase ~1.6 mb/d in 2018.&nbsp; In the U.S., petroleum consumption for 2017 will be approximately 20.2 mb/d or ~7.3-7.4 billion barrels/year, the most since 2007.</p<br><pThe argument for the takeover of the motor vehicle market by electric vehicles ignores the fact that the energy per unit mass of presently used lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles is less than 1/50<supth</sup that of gasoline or diesel fuel.&nbsp; Possibly there will be some improvement in lithium ion batteries in the future but not by a factor remotely close to 50.&nbsp; The much higher energy per unit mass for gasoline and diesel fuel provides a significant advantage for gasoline and diesel over lithium ion batteries, particularly in terms of hauling, towing and long-distance driving.</p<br><pTo compensate for the low energy per unit mass of lithium ion batteries in motor vehicles, exotic light weigh, and expensive, materials are used in the vehicles.&nbsp; For that reason, electric vehicles are expensive to make.</p<br><pAt present, auto companies subsidize the cost of electric vehicles through the sale of gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles.&nbsp; If they sell electric vehicles in large quantities, the subsidy would have to be removed so auto companies could make money on those sales.&nbsp; The federal government also presently provides a $7,500 tax credit to electric vehicle purchases although there has been talk of eliminating the tax credit by the current administration.</p<br><pAmericans were quite happy when the price of oil went down significantly in late 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several reasons for the decline in the price of oil.&nbsp; One was the rapid development of fracking in U.S.&nbsp; A second reason was the large increase of oil production in Iraq, from 2.398 mb/d in 2010 to 4.050 mb/d in 2015 according to EIA data.</p<br><pU.S. oil production from fracking (light tight oil) increased by 3.933 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 (EIA). &nbsp;Global crude + condensate production increased 5.618 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 so the increase from U.S. light tight oil and Iraq, 5.585 mb/d, represented almost all of the global production increase.</p<br><pThe increase for U.S. light tight oil production was achieved through intensive development of several key oil plays most importantly the Bakken Shale (North Dakota/Montana), Eagle Ford Shale (Texas), Permian Basin (Texas/New Mexico), Niobrara Shale (Colorado/Wyoming) and Anadarko Basin (Oklahoma/Texas).</p<br><pThe top 3 producing regions for fracked oil are Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken.&nbsp; They are significantly more productive than Niobrara and Anadarko.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now the hot play with production rapidly increasing.</p<br><pWhen the price of oil went down in late 2014, the rate of drilling decreased which provides an argument for the production declines in Bakken and Eagle Ford after their peaks in late 2014/early 2015.&nbsp; The price decline was indeed a factor but in the Bakken region of North Dakota, there were 2,817 more producing well, as of Dec. 2017, then there were in Dec. 2014.&nbsp; Oil companies didn’t stop drilling and completing wells.</p<br><pIt’s easy to assume that the Bakken Shale has truly huge quantities of oil based upon the extensive area of the play (see Figure 4) and the production results within the sweet spot.</p<br><p<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470827 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image006.png" alt="" width="259" height="194"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 4</strong</p<br><pThe problem is that about 90% of Bakken oil production in North Dakota comes from 4 counties out of the 16 in the Bakken region of North Dakota.&nbsp;

With intense development of shale oil and natural gas plays, it typically takes less than 10 years from initial production to the time of peak production.</p<br><pArt Berman has expressed the opinion that it’s unlikely that there will be shale plays that aren’t presently producing oil and/or gas in the U.S. that will produce significant quantities of oil and gas in the future.</p<br><pIn the initial boom of fracked shale oil production, there was a lot of hype about the quantity of oil available through fracking.&nbsp; The mainstream media made it sound like the quantity was so huge that it would ensure that the U.S. would be awash in oil for many, many decades to come.</p<br><pThe media appear to be basing their pronouncements on projections from the EIA.&nbsp; Petroleum geologist David Hughes has produced multiple reports highlighting the flawed assumptions of the EIA, the most recent of which is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/" target="_blank"http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/</a</p<br><pHughes states that EIA projections are <strongextremely</strong optimistic.&nbsp;

Based upon results thus far, that will not remotely be the case.</p<br><pWhy does the EIA assume that light tight oil production will remain high for decades to come?&nbsp; It appears to me that their objective is to provide comforting projections that will make the American public feel good, to feel that their high consumption lifestyles can continue for as long as the EIA can see into the future.</p<br><pThe EIA has a history of providing unrealistic projections, which I highlighted in this paper from 2012:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/"https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/</a</p<br><pUnfortunately, the U.S. media never questions the projections of the EIA.</p<br><pWhat oil companies are doing in the shale plays is extracting the oil that exists as rapidly as humanly possible.&nbsp; The objective of oil executives is to make their millions or billions of dollars before they’re pushing up daisies.&nbsp; There isn’t a lot of thought about the long-term consequences.</p<br><pBased upon results from Barnett, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, economically recoverable oil and gas is far more limited than the EIA is portraying.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now experiencing extremely intensive development which will lead to the peaking of production in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp; Fracking will be a relatively short-term phenomenon in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;As Art Berman says, “fracking is a retirement party for petroleum geologists”.</p<br><pThe current administration is doing everything possible to open all federal areas closed to oil development in the U.S.&nbsp; The reality is that most federal areas closed to oil development do not have the geology necessary to produce large quantities of oil.</p

This<br>Special Report identifies two main conceptual pathways to illustrate different interpretations. One stabilizes<br>global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before<br>coming back down. Countries’ pledges to reduce their emissions are currently not in line with limiting global<br>warming to 1.5°C.<br>Scientists use computer models to simulate the emissions of greenhouse gases that would be consistent with<br>different levels of warming. The different possibilities are often referred to as ‘greenhouse gas emission<br>pathways’. There is no single, definitive pathway to limiting warming to 1.5°C.<br>This IPCC special report identifies two main pathways that explore global warming of 1.5°C. The first involves<br>global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees<br>warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and<br>return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an ‘overshoot’ pathway. Any alternative<br>situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st<br>century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.<br>The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change<br>impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an ‘overshoot’, the<br>greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, on top of reducing<br>the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO2 removal have not been proven to work at scale and,<br>therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that<br>the use of CO2 removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not<br>appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer<br>overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves<br>and accelerated sea level rise.<br>Countries that formally accept or ‘ratify’ the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address<br>climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions<br>(NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all<br>the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to<br>reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the<br>national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and<br>technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to<br>1.5°C at a later date.<br>A world that is consistent with holding warming to 1.5°C would see greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline<br>in the coming decade, with strong international cooperation and a scaling up of countries’ combined ambition<br>beyond current NDCs. In contrast, delayed action, limited international cooperation, and weak or fragmented<br>policies that lead to stagnating or increasing greenhouse gas emissions would put the possibility of limiting<br>global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels out of reach.<br>(continued on next page)<br>10<br>Frequently Asked Questions<br>FAQ<br>FAQ 2.1, Figure 1 | Two main pathways for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels are discussed in this Special Report. These are:<br>stabilizing global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C (left) and global temperature temporarily exceeding 1.5°C before coming back down later in the century<br>(right). Temperatures shown are relative to pre-industrial but pathways are illustrative only, demonstrating conceptual not quantitative characteristics.<br>FAQ 2.1 (continued)<br>11<br>Frequently Asked Questions<br>FAQ<br>Frequently Asked Questions<br>FAQ 2.2 | What do Energy Supply and Demand have to do with Limiting Warming<br>to 1.5°C?<br>Summary: Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes<br>in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could<br>mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use<br>less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater – for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that<br>remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.<br>To stabilize global temperature at any level, ‘net’ CO2 emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the<br>amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between<br>CO2 ‘sources’ and ‘sinks’ is often referred to as ‘net zero’ emissions or ‘carbon neutrality’. The implication of net<br>zero emissions is that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new<br>equilibrium is reached, as CO2 emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and<br>the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries.<br>Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required<br>greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society’s main sectors,<br>including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions<br>that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of<br>energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the ‘carbon footprint’ of the food<br>we consume.<br>The above are examples of ‘supply-side’ actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse<br>gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy<br>human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as ‘demand-side’<br>actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energyand greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand- and<br>supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other.

It’s common to hear that electric vehicles are going to take over the motor vehicle market sometime soon and eliminate much of the demand for oil in the not-too-distant future.</p<br><pIn spite of those claims, which have been made for some years now, global oil consumption has risen at a rate of nearly 1 million barrels/day (mb/d) per year on average from 2000 to 2017.&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration (US DOE/EIA or EIA) is predicting that global petroleum consumption (this includes all hydrocarbon liquids) will increase ~1.6 mb/d in 2018.&nbsp; In the U.S., petroleum consumption for 2017 will be approximately 20.2 mb/d or ~7.3-7.4 billion barrels/year, the most since 2007.</p<br><pThe argument for the takeover of the motor vehicle market by electric vehicles ignores the fact that the energy per unit mass of presently used lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles is less than 1/50<supth</sup that of gasoline or diesel fuel.&nbsp; Possibly there will be some improvement in lithium ion batteries in the future but not by a factor remotely close to 50.&nbsp; The much higher energy per unit mass for gasoline and diesel fuel provides a significant advantage for gasoline and diesel over lithium ion batteries, particularly in terms of hauling, towing and long-distance driving.</p<br><pTo compensate for the low energy per unit mass of lithium ion batteries in motor vehicles, exotic light weigh, and expensive, materials are used in the vehicles.&nbsp; For that reason, electric vehicles are expensive to make.</p<br><pAt present, auto companies subsidize the cost of electric vehicles through the sale of gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles.&nbsp; If they sell electric vehicles in large quantities, the subsidy would have to be removed so auto companies could make money on those sales.&nbsp; The federal government also presently provides a $7,500 tax credit to electric vehicle purchases although there has been talk of eliminating the tax credit by the current administration.</p<br><pAmericans were quite happy when the price of oil went down significantly in late 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several reasons for the decline in the price of oil.&nbsp; One was the rapid development of fracking in U.S.&nbsp; A second reason was the large increase of oil production in Iraq, from 2.398 mb/d in 2010 to 4.050 mb/d in 2015 according to EIA data.</p<br><pU.S. oil production from fracking (light tight oil) increased by 3.933 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 (EIA). &nbsp;Global crude + condensate production increased 5.618 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 so the increase from U.S. light tight oil and Iraq, 5.585 mb/d, represented almost all of the global production increase.</p<br><pThe increase for U.S. light tight oil production was achieved through intensive development of several key oil plays most importantly the Bakken Shale (North Dakota/Montana), Eagle Ford Shale (Texas), Permian Basin (Texas/New Mexico), Niobrara Shale (Colorado/Wyoming) and Anadarko Basin (Oklahoma/Texas).</p<br><pThe top 3 producing regions for fracked oil are Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken.&nbsp; They are significantly more productive than Niobrara and Anadarko.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now the hot play with production rapidly increasing.</p<br><pWhen the price of oil went down in late 2014, the rate of drilling decreased which provides an argument for the production declines in Bakken and Eagle Ford after their peaks in late 2014/early 2015.&nbsp; The price decline was indeed a factor but in the Bakken region of North Dakota, there were 2,817 more producing well, as of Dec. 2017, then there were in Dec. 2014.&nbsp; Oil companies didn’t stop drilling and completing wells.</p<br><pIt’s easy to assume that the Bakken Shale has truly huge quantities of oil based upon the extensive area of the play (see Figure 4) and the production results within the sweet spot.</p<br><p<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470827 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image006.png" alt="" width="259" height="194"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 4</strong</p<br><pThe problem is that about 90% of Bakken oil production in North Dakota comes from 4 counties out of the 16 in the Bakken region of North Dakota.&nbsp; Those 4 counties are where the sweet spot is located.&nbsp; Drilling outside of the sweet spot results in significantly lower oil production.&nbsp; From my experience, a high percentage of the wells in the sweet spot have initial production values over 1,000 b/d whereas outside of the sweet spot, initial production values are often less than 100 b/d.</p<br><pFor the period 2008-2017, total Bakken Shale oil production in North Dakota was 2.32 billion barrels.&nbsp; Art Berman, a petroleum geologist with decades of experience in the U.S. oil and gas industry, has estimated the economically recoverable amount of oil from Bakken, including Montana, to be approximately 5 billion barrels.&nbsp; The amount of oil produced from the North Dakota Bakken play over the last 10 years is approaching half of 5 billion barrels.</p<br><p<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470828 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008.png" alt="" width="772" height="450" srcset="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008.png 772w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008-304x177.png 304w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 5</strong</p<br><pFor the period 2008-2017, total Eagle Ford Shale oil production was 1.94 billion barrels (See Figure 6).&nbsp;

In 2016, there were periods with no drilling rigs because the region had been drilled to the point of saturation.&nbsp; Since 2012, natural gas production from the Barnett Shale has declined by over 40% and will likely continue to decline. &nbsp;The sweet spots of Bakken and Eagle Ford have now been fairly extensively drilled which creates a problem for future production like the problem in the Barnett Shale.</p<br><pHere is what Wikipedia says about the Barnett Shale region:</p<br><blockquote<pAs of 2007, some experts suggested that the Barnett Shale might have the largest producible reserves of any onshore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas" target="_blank"natural gas</a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_field" target="_blank"field</a in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"United States</a.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Shale#cite_note-impact-study-1" target="_blank"<sup[1]</sup</a The field is thought to have 2.5×10<sup12</sup&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (71&nbsp;km<sup3</sup) of recoverable natural gas, and 30×10<sup12</sup&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (850&nbsp;km<sup3</sup) of natural gas in place.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Shale#cite_note-impact-study-1" target="_blank"<sup[1]</sup</a</p</blockquote<br><pThe point here is that the Barnett Shale is not an insignificant source of natural gas for the U.S.&nbsp; With intense development of shale oil and natural gas plays, it typically takes less than 10 years from initial production to the time of peak production.</p<br><pArt Berman has expressed the opinion that it’s unlikely that there will be shale plays that aren’t presently producing oil and/or gas in the U.S. that will produce significant quantities of oil and gas in the future.</p<br><pIn the initial boom of fracked shale oil production, there was a lot of hype about the quantity of oil available through fracking.&nbsp; The mainstream media made it sound like the quantity was so huge that it would ensure that the U.S. would be awash in oil for many, many decades to come.</p<br><pThe media appear to be basing their pronouncements on projections from the EIA.&nbsp; Petroleum geologist David Hughes has produced multiple reports highlighting the flawed assumptions of the EIA, the most recent of which is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/" target="_blank"http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/</a</p<br><pHughes states that EIA projections are <strongextremely</strong optimistic.&nbsp; That is a polite way of saying they are delusional.&nbsp; It appears that the EIA is assuming that well productivity outside of the sweet spots will parallel well productivity within the sweet spots.&nbsp; Based upon results thus far, that will not remotely be the case.</p<br><pWhy does the EIA assume that light tight oil production will remain high for decades to come?&nbsp; It appears to me that their objective is to provide comforting projections that will make the American public feel good, to feel that their high consumption lifestyles can continue for as long as the EIA can see into the future.</p<br><pThe EIA has a history of providing unrealistic projections, which I highlighted in this paper from 2012:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/"https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/</a</p<br><pUnfortunately, the U.S. media never questions the projections of the EIA.</p<br><pWhat oil companies are doing in the shale plays is extracting the oil that exists as rapidly as humanly possible.&nbsp; The objective of oil executives is to make their millions or billions of dollars before they’re pushing up daisies.&nbsp; There isn’t a lot of thought about the long-term consequences.</p<br><pBased upon results from Barnett, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, economically recoverable oil and gas is far more limited than the EIA is portraying.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now experiencing extremely intensive development which will lead to the peaking of production in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp; Fracking will be a relatively short-term phenomenon in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;As Art Berman says, “fracking is a retirement party for petroleum geologists”.</p<br><pThe current administration is doing everything possible to open all federal areas closed to oil development in the U.S.&nbsp; The reality is that most federal areas closed to oil development do not have the geology necessary to produce large quantities of oil.</p

Even if the USGS says there are 896 million barrels (mb) of oil, that doesn’t mean it’s economically extractable.&nbsp; Alaska is now producing about 25% of what it was producing at its peak in the late 1980s (~0.5 mb/d vs 2.1 mb/d) in spite of many new fields brought on-line and new areas opened for oil development.</p<br><pWith the passage of the recent federal tax bill, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been opened for oil development (ANWR is east of the Prudhoe Bay region).&nbsp; It is probably the last significant area in the U.S. that is geologically favorable for oil left in the U.S.</p<br><pI heard a comment on the radio recently that ANWR contains 19 Gb (billion barrels) of oil.&nbsp; A common tactic of proponents of oil drilling is to greatly exaggerate how much oil is in a region to make it appear too appealing to pass up.&nbsp; In reality, the best that could be hoped for is maybe 3-4 Gb of <strongeconomically</strong extractable oil.&nbsp; There is a good possibility that there is considerably less than 3-4 Gb of economically recoverable oil in ANWR.</p<br><pAmericans appear to believe that they are entitled to cheap and abundant oil and that the cheap and abundant oil will last forever.&nbsp; Cheap and abundant oil will go on until it can’t go on.&nbsp; Even the largest oil fields ultimately decline.&nbsp; As an example, the largest oil complex in the western world is the Cantarell Complex in Mexico (Estimated Ultimate Recovery, EUR,~20 Gb).&nbsp; In 2004 Cantarell was producing 2.1 mb/d.&nbsp; It Is presently producing approximately 0.25 mb/d (~12% of maximum production) as it rapidly declines.</p<br><pThe Prudhoe Bay oil field (Alaska) is the largest field ever discovered in the U.S. (EUR ~12 Gb).&nbsp; In 1988 it was producing 1.6 mb/d.&nbsp; In 2017, Prudhoe Bay, along with its satellite fields, produced ~0.28 mb/d (17.5% of maximum production) as it continues to decline.&nbsp; The large fields in the North Sea such as Brent, Piper, Forties, Statfjord, Oseberg, Gullfaks and many more show the same tendency to decline.&nbsp; The largest fields in the Middle East like Ghawar (EUR ~120 Gb) and Burgan (EUR ~70 Gb) are showing signs of strain from decades of intensive pumping.</p<br><pAre there not moral issues when it comes to using finite natural resources?&nbsp;

Cumulative world oil production at the end of 2017 was approximately 1.36 trillion barrels (1,360 billion barrels).&nbsp; Since WWII, approximately 95% of the cumulative total global oil production has been produced (See Figure 1 by Jean Laherrere-the top brown line represents global oil production).</p<br><p<img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470823 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001.png" alt="" width="835" height="597" srcset="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001.png 835w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001-280x200.png 280w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 1</strong</p<br><pJean Laherrere, an international petroleum geologist with over 50 years of experience, had estimated ultimate recoverable oil, excluding extra heavy oil, at approximately 2.2 trillion barrels back in 2013.&nbsp; It’s a good bet that the ultimate recovery of <strongeconomically </strongrecoverable oil will be less than 3 trillion barrels.&nbsp; At the clip we’re burning oil, we could go through a significant percentage of the remaining economically recoverable oil in the next 20 years.</p<br><pUgo Bardi makes the case that the actual oil production curve will look more like Figure 2.</p
