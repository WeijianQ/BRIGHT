## Original Question

*I would like to know what would happen with the atmosphere of Venus when it gets tidally locked, i.e. when one side would perpetually face the Sun.
Probably a thermal low would be at the subsolar region then.

At the surface Venus has an atmospheric pressure of 92 atm. and a temperature of 462⁰
 C.

Are there General Circulation Models or Global Climate Models that can handle such input parameters ?

If so, are there GCM users (groups, universities etc.) who could run a tidally locked Venus simulation ?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is understanding how the atmosphere of Venus would behave if the planet were to become tidally locked with the Sun, resulting in one side always facing the Sun while the other remains in perpetual darkness. This scenario raises questions about the atmospheric dynamics, pressure, temperature distributions, and the overall climate system of Venus under such conditions. To address this, we'll consider the application of General Circulation Models (GCMs) or Global Climate Models to simulate these conditions, and the potential research groups or institutions that might be able to run such simulations.

### Step 1: Understanding Venus's Current Atmospheric Conditions

Venus's atmosphere is significantly different from Earth's, with a dense CO2 atmosphere leading to extreme greenhouse gas effects. The current surface conditions include a pressure of 92 atm and a temperature of approximately 462°C. These conditions present unique challenges for modeling, as they require the GCM to accurately handle extreme atmospheric dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer processes.

### Step 2: The Concept of Tidal Locking and Its Implications

Tidal locking is a state where a planet's orbital period matches its rotational period, causing one side of the planet to permanently face the star it orbits. This would result in a permanent day side and a permanent night side on Venus. The subsolar point (the point directly facing the Sun) would likely become an intense thermal low due to extreme heating, while the opposite side would be much cooler. This extreme temperature gradient could drive unprecedented atmospheric circulation patterns.

### Step 3: GCMs Capable of Handling Extreme Venus Conditions

General Circulation Models (GCMs) or Global Climate Models are sophisticated tools that simulate the climate and atmospheric conditions of celestial bodies. To model a tidally locked Venus, a GCM would need to be capable of handling:

- Extreme temperature and pressure conditions
- Non-Earth-like atmospheric composition
- Radiative transfer under intense solar radiation
- Potential changes in cloud cover and atmospheric chemistry

Some GCMs have been adapted or designed to study exoplanets and their atmospheres, which often involve extreme conditions including tidal locking. These models could potentially be adapted to study Venus under a tidally locked scenario.

### Step 4: Potential Research Groups or Institutions

Several institutions and research groups around the world specialize in planetary science and climate modeling, including:

- NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center
- The European Space Agency (ESA)
- Universities with strong planetary science departments (e.g., MIT, Caltech, University of Colorado Boulder)
- Research institutions focusing on exoplanet studies

These groups may already have the necessary tools or could potentially develop or adapt existing GCMs to simulate a tidally locked Venus. Collaboration with exoplanet researchers could be particularly fruitful, given their experience with modeling planets under a wide range of conditions, including tidal locking.

### Conclusion

Simulating the atmosphere of a tidally locked Venus presents significant challenges due to the extreme conditions involved. However, with advances in GCM technology and the expertise of planetary scientists and climatologists, it is within the realm of possibility to explore such scenarios. Identifying or developing a GCM capable of handling Venus's extreme conditions would be the first step, followed by collaboration with institutions or research groups experienced in such simulations. This would not only shed light on the potential climate dynamics of a tidally locked Venus but also contribute to our understanding of exoplanetary climates under similar conditions.

A land-ocean pattern like that above was used in a climate model to show how storm clouds could have shielded ancient Venus from strong sunlight and made the planet habitable.NASA.Venus may have had a shallow liquid-water ocean and habitable surface temperatures for up to 2 billion years of its early history, according to computer modeling of the planet’s ancient climate by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York.The findings, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, were obtained with a model similar to the type used to predict future climate change on Earth.“Many of the same tools we use to model climate change on Earth can be adapted to study climates on other planets, both past and present,” said Michael Way, a researcher at GISS and the paper’s lead author. “These results show ancient Venus may have been a very different place than it is today.”Venus today is a hellish world. It has a crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere 90 times as thick as Earth’s. There is almost no water vapor. Temperatures reach 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius) at its surface.Scientists long have theorized that Venus formed out of ingredients similar to Earth’s, but followed a different evolutionary path. Measurements by NASA’s Pioneer mission to Venus in the 1980s first suggested Venus originally may have had an ocean. However, Venus is closer to the sun than Earth and receives far more sunlight. As a result, the planet’s early ocean evaporated, water-vapor molecules were broken apart by ultraviolet radiation, and hydrogen escaped to space. With no water left on the surface, carbon dioxide built up in the atmosphere, leading to a so-called runaway greenhouse effect that created present conditions.Previous studies have shown that how fast a planet spins on its axis affects whether it has a habitable climate. A solar day on Venus is 117 Earth days (a sidereal day on Venus is 243 Earth days). Until recently, it was assumed that a thick atmosphere like that of modern Venus was required for the planet to have today’s slow rotation rate. However, newer research has shown that a thin atmosphere like that of modern Earth could have produced the same result. That means an ancient Venus with an Earth-like atmosphere could have had the same rotation rate it has today.Another factor that impacts a planet’s climate is topography. The GISS team postulated ancient Venus had more dry land overall than Earth, especially in the tropics. That limits the amount of water evaporated from the oceans and, as a result, the greenhouse effect by water vapor. This type of surface appears ideal for making a planet habitable; there seems to have been enough water to support abundant life, with sufficient land to reduce the planet’s sensitivity to changes from incoming sunlight.Way and his GISS colleagues simulated conditions of a hypothetical early Venus with an atmosphere similar to Earth’s, a day as long as Venus’ current day, and a shallow ocean consistent with early data from the Pioneer spacecraft. The researchers added information about Venus’ topography from radar measurements taken by NASA’s Magellan mission in the 1990s, and filled the lowlands with water, leaving the highlands exposed as Venusian continents. The study also factored in an ancient sun that was up to 30 percent dimmer. Even so, ancient Venus still received about 40 percent more sunlight than Earth does today.“In the GISS model’s simulation, Venus’ slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time,” co-author and fellow GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said. “This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.”The research was done as part of NASA’s Planetary Science Astrobiology program through the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) program, which seeks to accelerate the search for life on planets orbiting other stars, or exoplanets, by combining insights from the fields of astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, and Earth science. The findings have direct implications for future NASA missions, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and James Webb Space Telescope, which will try to detect possible habitable planets and characterize their atmospheres.Related linksRead the paper in Geophysical Research LettersNASA GISS' NExSS activitiesNASA GISS websiteShareDetailsLast UpdatedMar 18, 2024EditorNASA Science Editorial Team Related TermsCarbon CycleClimate ChangeExplore More3 min readNASA Data Helps Beavers Build Back StreamsHumans aren’t the only mammals working to mitigate the effects of climate change in the Western United States.

> part5 -------------------<br>Negative feedbacks[edit]<br>Planck feedback[edit]<br>As the temperature of a black body increases, the emission of infrared radiation increases with the fourth power of its absolute temperature according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law. This increases the amount of outgoing radiation back into space as the Earth warms.  It is a strong stabilizing response and has sometimes been called the "no-feedback response" because it is an intensive property of a thermodynamic system when considered to be purely a function of temperature.  Although Earth has an effective emissivity less than unity, the ideal black body radiation emerges as a separable quantity when investigating perturbations to the planet's outgoing radiation.<br>The Planck feedback or Planck response is the comparable radiative response obtained from analysis of practical observations or global climate models (GCMs). Its expected strength has been most simply estimated from the derivative of the Stefan-Boltzmann equation as -4σT = -3.8 W/m/K.  Accounting from GCM applications has sometimes yielded a reduced strength, as caused by extensive properties of the stratosphere and similar residual artifacts subsequently identified as being absent from such models.   Most extensive "grey body" properties of Earth that influence the outgoing radiation are usually postulated to be encompassed by the other GCM feedback components, and to be distributed in accordance with a particular forcing-feedback formulation of the climate system.  Ideally the Planck feedback strength obtained from GCMs, indirect measurements, and black body estimates will further converge as analysis methods continue to mature.<br>This blackbody radiation or Planck response has been identified as "the most fundamental feedback in the climate system".<br>Carbon cycle negative feedbacks[edit]<br>The impulse response following a 100 GtC injection of CO2 into Earth's atmosphere.  The majority of excess carbon is removed by ocean and land sinks in less than a few centuries, while a substantial portion persists.<br>Negative climate feedbacks from Earth's carbon cycle are thought to be relatively insensitive to temperature changes.   For this reason they are sometimes considered separately or disregarded in studies which aim to quantify climate sensitivity.   They are nevertheless significant feedbacks to anthropogenic CO2 emissions over time, and have influence on climate inertia and within more general studies of dynamic (time-dependent) climate change.<br>Role of oceans[edit]<br>Following Le Chatelier's principle, the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's carbon cycle will shift in response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The primary driver of this is the ocean, which absorbs anthropogenic CO2 via the so-called solubility pump. At present this accounts for only about one third of the current emissions, but ultimately most (~75%) of the CO2 emitted by human activities will dissolve in the ocean over a period of centuries: "A better approximation of the lifetime of fossil fuel CO2 for public discussion might be 300 years, plus 25% that lasts forever". However, the rate at which the ocean will take it up in the future is less certain, and will be affected by stratification induced by warming and, potentially, changes in the ocean's thermohaline circulation.<br>Chemical weathering[edit]<br>Chemical weathering over the geological long term acts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. With current global warming, weathering is increasing, demonstrating significant feedbacks between climate and Earth surface. Biosequestration also captures and stores CO2 by biological processes.  The formation of shells by organisms in the ocean, over a very long time, removes CO2 from the oceans.  The complete conversion of CO2 to limestone takes thousands to hundreds of thousands of years.<br>Primary production through photosynthesis[edit]<br>Net primary productivity changes in response to increased CO2, as plants photosynthesis increased in response to increasing concentrations.  However, this effect is swamped by other changes in the biosphere due to global warming.

> part8 -------------------<br>Possible origin of Theia[edit]<br>One suggested pathway for the impact as viewed from the direction of Earth's south pole (not to scale).<br>In 2004, Princeton University mathematician Edward Belbruno and astrophysicist J. Richard Gott III proposed that Theia coalesced at the L4 or L5 Lagrangian point relative to Earth (in about the same orbit and about 60° ahead or behind), similar to a trojan asteroid. Two-dimensional computer models suggest that the stability of Theia's proposed trojan orbit would have been affected when its growing mass exceeded a threshold of approximately 10% of Earth's mass (the mass of Mars). In this scenario, gravitational perturbations by planetesimals caused Theia to depart from its stable Lagrangian location, and subsequent interactions with proto-Earth led to a collision between the two bodies.<br>In 2008, evidence was presented that suggests that the collision might have occurred later than the accepted value of 4.53 Gya, at approximately 4.48 Gya. A 2014 comparison of computer simulations with elemental abundance measurements in Earth's mantle indicated that the collision occurred approximately 95 My after the formation of the Solar System.<br>It has been suggested that other significant objects might have been created by the impact, which could have remained in orbit between Earth and the Moon, stuck in Lagrangian points. Such objects might have stayed within the Earth–Moon system for as long as 100 million years, until the gravitational tugs of other planets destabilised the system enough to free the objects. A study published in 2011 suggested that a subsequent collision between the Moon and one of these smaller bodies caused the notable differences in physical characteristics between the two hemispheres of the Moon. This collision, simulations have supported, would have been at a low enough velocity so as not to form a crater; instead, the material from the smaller body would have spread out across the Moon (in what would become its far side), adding a thick layer of highlands crust. The resulting mass irregularities would subsequently produce a gravity gradient that resulted in tidal locking of the Moon so that today, only the near side remains visible from Earth. However, mapping by the GRAIL mission has ruled out this scenario.<br>In 2019, a team at the University of Münster reported that the molybdenum isotopic composition in Earth's primitive mantle originates from the outer Solar System, hinting at the source of water on Earth. One possible explanation is that Theia originated in the outer Solar System.

Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, chemistry, geology, physics, and planetary science. Since the dawn of the Space Age in the 1950s and the discovery of exoplanets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.<br>The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later to have been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's Moon, may be the result of giant collisions. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. Beyond Neptune, many sub-planet sized objects formed. Several thousand trans-Neptunian objects have been observed. Unlike the planets, these trans-Neptunian objects mostly move on eccentric orbits, inclined to the plane of the planets. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.[2] Planetary migration may have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.[according to whom?]<br>In roughly 5 billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a red giant), before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf. In the distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, and others ejected into interstellar space. Ultimately, over the course of tens of billions of years, it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it.[3]<br><br><br>History[edit]<br>Main article: History of Solar System formation and evolution hypotheses<br>Pierre-Simon Laplace, one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis<br>Ideas concerning the origin and fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories to the existence of a "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of heliocentrism, which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the Earth in orbit around it. This concept had been developed for millennia (Aristarchus of Samos had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century. The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.[4]<br>The current standard theory for Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen into and out of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets.[5] However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.[6]<br>Understanding of how the Sun is expected to continue to evolve required an understanding of the source of its power. Arthur Stanley Eddington's confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity led to his realisation that the Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion reactions in its core, fusing hydrogen into helium.[7] In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements also might form within stars.[8] Fred Hoyle elaborated on this premise by arguing that evolved stars called red giants created many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores. When a red giant finally casts off its outer layers, these elements would then be recycled to form other star systems.[8]<br><br>Formation[edit]<br>See also: Nebular hypothesis<br>Presolar nebula[edit]<br>The nebular hypothesis says that the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a fragment of a giant molecular cloud,[9] most likely at the edge of a Wolf-Rayet bubble.[10] The cloud was about 20 parsecs (65 light years) across,[9] while the fragments were roughly 1 parsec (three and a quarter light-years) across.[11] The further collapse of the fragments led to the formation of dense cores 0.01–0.1 parsec (2,000–20,000 AU) in size.[a][9][12] One of these collapsing fragments (known as the presolar nebula) formed what became the Solar System.[13] The composition of this region with a mass just over that of the Sun (M☉) was about the same as that of the Sun today, with hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of lithium produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis, forming about 98% of its mass. The remaining 2% of the mass consisted of heavier elements that were created by nucleosynthesis in earlier generations of stars.[14] Late in the life of these stars, they ejected heavier elements into the interstellar medium.[15] Some scientists have given the name Coatlicue to a hypothetical star that went supernova and created the presolar nebula.<br><br>Hubble image of protoplanetary discs in the Orion Nebula, a light-years-wide stellar nursery probably very similar to the primordial nebula from which the Sun formed<br>The oldest inclusions found in meteorites, thought to trace the first solid material to form in the presolar nebula, are 4,568.2 million years old, which is one definition of the age of the Solar System.[1] Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that only form in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae occurred nearby. A shock wave from a supernova may have triggered the formation of the Sun by creating relatively dense regions within the cloud, causing these regions to collapse.[16][17] The highly homogeneous distribution of iron-60 in the Solar System points to the occurrence of this supernova and its injection of iron-60 being well before the accretion of nebular dust into planetary bodies.[18] Because only massive, short-lived stars produce supernovae, the Sun must have formed in a large star-forming region that produced massive stars, possibly similar to the Orion Nebula.[19][20] Studies of the structure of the Kuiper belt and of anomalous materials within it suggest that the Sun formed within a cluster of between 1,000 and 10,000 stars with a diameter of between 6.5 and 19.5 light years and a collective mass of 3,000 M☉. This cluster began to break apart between 135 million and 535 million years after formation.[21][22] Several simulations of our young Sun interacting with close-passing stars over the first 100 million years of its life produced anomalous orbits observed in the outer Solar System, such as detached objects.[23]<br>Because of the conservation of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the temperature rose. The center, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.[11] Over about 100,000 years,[9] the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200 AU[11] and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.[24] Since about half of all known stars form systems of multiple stars and because Jupiter is made of the same elements as the Sun (hydrogen and helium), it has been suggested that the Solar System might have been early in its formation a protostar system with Jupiter being the second but failed protostar, but Jupiter has far too little mass to trigger fusion in its core and so became a gas giant; it is in fact younger than the Sun and the oldest planet of the Solar System.[25][26]<br>At this point in the Sun's evolution, the Sun is thought to have been a T Tauri star.[27] Studies of T Tauri stars show that they are often accompanied by discs of pre-planetary matter with masses of 0.001–0.1 M☉.[28] These discs extend to several hundred AU—the Hubble Space Telescope has observed protoplanetary discs of up to 1000 AU in diameter in star-forming regions such as the Orion Nebula[29]—and are rather cool, reaching a surface temperature of only about 1,000 K (730 °C; 1,340 °F) at their hottest.[30]<br>Within 50 million years, the temperature and pressure at the core of the Sun became so great that its hydrogen began to fuse, creating an internal source of energy that countered gravitational contraction until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved.[31] This marked the Sun's entry into the prime phase of its life, known as the main sequence. Main-sequence stars derive energy from the fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores. The Sun remains a main-sequence star today.[32]<br>As the early Solar System continued to evolve, it eventually drifted away from its siblings in the stellar nursery, and continued orbiting the Milky Way's center on its own. The Sun likely drifted from its original orbital distance from the center of the galaxy. The chemical history of the Sun suggests it may have formed as much as 3 kpc closer to the galaxy core.[33]<br><br>Solar system birth environment[edit]<br>Like most stars, the Sun likely formed not in isolation but as part of a young star cluster.[34] There are several indications that hint at the cluster environment having had some influence of the young still forming solar system. For example, the decline in mass beyond Neptune and the extreme eccentric-orbit of Sedna have been interpreted as a signature of the solar system having been influenced by its birth environment. Whether the presence of the isotopes iron-60 and aluminium-26 can be interpreted as a sign of a birth cluster containing massive stars is still under debate.  If the Sun was part of a star cluster, it might have been influenced by close flybys of other stars, the strong radiation of nearby massive stars and ejecta from supernovae occurring close by.<br><br>Formation of the planets[edit]<br>See also: Protoplanetary disk and § Terrestrial planets<br>The various planets are thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation.[35] The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central protostar. Through direct contact and self-organization, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 m (660 ft) in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10 km (6.2 mi) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year over the course of the next few million years.[36]<br>The inner Solar System, the region of the Solar System inside 4 AU, was too warm for volatile molecules like water and methane to condense, so the planetesimals that formed there could only form from compounds with high melting points, such as metals (like iron, nickel, and aluminium) and rocky silicates. These rocky bodies would become the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars). These compounds are quite rare in the Universe, comprising only 0.6% of the mass of the nebula, so the terrestrial planets could not grow very large.[11] The terrestrial embryos grew to about 0.05 Earth masses (ME) and ceased accumulating matter about 100,000 years after the formation of the Sun; subsequent collisions and mergers between these planet-sized bodies allowed terrestrial planets to grow to their present sizes.[37]<br>When terrestrial planets were forming, they remained immersed in a disk of gas and dust. Pressure partially supported the gas and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, and as a result the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration,[38][39] but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.[40]<br>The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets, allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.[11] Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 ME within about 3 million years.[37] Today, the four giant planets comprise just under 99% of all the mass orbiting the Sun.[b] Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line. Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material, it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun. In effect, the frost line acted as a barrier that caused the material to accumulate rapidly at ~5 AU from the Sun. This excess material coalesced into a large embryo (or core) on the order of 10 ME, which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever-increasing rate.[41][42] Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass, growth proceeded very rapidly, reaching about 150 Earth masses ~105 years thereafter and finally topping out at 318 ME.[43] Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter, when there was less gas available to consume.[37][44]<br>T Tauri stars like the young Sun have far stronger stellar winds than more stable, older stars. Uranus and Neptune are thought to have formed after Jupiter and Saturn did, when the strong solar wind had blown away much of the disc material. As a result, those planets accumulated little hydrogen and helium—not more than 1 ME each. Uranus and Neptune are sometimes referred to as failed cores.[45] The main problem with formation theories for these planets is the timescale of their formation. At the current locations it would have taken millions of years for their cores to accrete.[44] This means that Uranus and Neptune may have formed closer to the Sun—near or even between Jupiter and Saturn—and later migrated or were ejected outward (see Planetary migration below).[45][46] Motion in the planetesimal era was not all inward toward the Sun; the Stardust sample return from Comet Wild 2 has suggested that materials from the early formation of the Solar System migrated from the warmer inner Solar System to the region of the Kuiper belt.[47]<br>After between three and ten million years,[37] the young Sun's solar wind would have cleared away all the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disc, blowing it into interstellar space, thus ending the growth of the planets.[48][49]<br><br>Subsequent evolution[edit]<br>The planets were originally thought to have formed in or near their current orbits. This has been questioned during the last 20 years. Currently, many planetary scientists think that the Solar System might have looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury may have been present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System may have been much more compact than it is now, and the Kuiper belt may have been much closer to the Sun.[50]<br><br>Terrestrial planets[edit]<br>At the end of the planetary formation epoch, the inner Solar System was populated by 50–100 Moon-to-Mars-sized protoplanets.[51][52] Further growth was possible only because these bodies collided and merged, which took less than 100 million years. These objects would have gravitationally interacted with one another, tugging at each other's orbits until they collided, growing larger until the four terrestrial planets we know today took shape.[37] One such giant collision is thought to have formed the Moon (see Moons below), while another removed the outer envelope of the young Mercury.[53]<br>One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today.[51] One hypothesis for this "eccentricity dumping" is that terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The "gravitational drag" of this residual gas would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits.[52] However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place.[37] Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.[54]<br><br>Asteroid belt[edit]<br>The outer edge of the terrestrial region, between 2 and 4 AU from the Sun, is called the asteroid belt. The asteroid belt initially contained more than enough matter to form 2–3 Earth-like planets, and, indeed, a large number of planetesimals formed there. As with the terrestrials, planetesimals in this region later coalesced and formed 20–30 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos;[55] however, the proximity of Jupiter meant that after this planet formed, 3 million years after the Sun, the region's history changed dramatically.[51] Orbital resonances with Jupiter and Saturn are particularly strong in the asteroid belt, and gravitational interactions with more massive embryos scattered many planetesimals into those resonances. Jupiter's gravity increased the velocity of objects within these resonances, causing them to shatter upon collision with other bodies, rather than accrete.[56]<br>As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.[57] The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities.[55][58] Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and played a role in the final accretion of the terrestrial planets.[55][59][60] During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.[58]<br>This is still 10–20 times more than the current mass in the main belt, which is now about 0.0005 ME.[61] A secondary depletion period that brought the asteroid belt down close to its present mass is thought to have followed when Jupiter and Saturn entered a temporary 2:1 orbital resonance (see below).<br>The inner Solar System's period of giant impacts probably played a role in Earth acquiring its current water content (~6×1021 kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System.[62] The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter.[59] A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has also been suggested as a possible source for Earth's water.[62][63] In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water.[2][64] The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.[65]<br><br>Planetary migration[edit]<br>Main articles: Nice model and Grand tack hypothesis<br>According to the nebular hypothesis, the outer two planets may be in the "wrong place". Uranus and Neptune (known as the "ice giants") exist in a region where the reduced density of the solar nebula and longer orbital times render their formation there highly implausible.[66] The two are instead thought to have formed in orbits near Jupiter and Saturn (known as the "gas giants"), where more material was available, and to have migrated outward to their current positions over hundreds of millions of years.[45]<br><br>Simulation showing outer planets and Kuiper belt:[2] a) Before Jupiter/Saturn 2:1 resonance b) Scattering of Kuiper belt objects into the Solar System after the orbital shift of Neptune c) After ejection of Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter   Orbit of Jupiter   Orbit of Saturn   Orbit of Uranus   Orbit of Neptune<br>The migration of the outer planets is also necessary to account for the existence and properties of the Solar System's outermost regions.[46] Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet.[66] The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55 AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100 AU,[46] and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000 AU.[67] Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30 AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20 AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up in opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.[68][2][46]<br>According to the Nice model, after the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600 million years (about 4 billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.[46] This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.[68]<br>The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.[46] This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.[c] Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;[46] those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.[46] This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances.[69] Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of Uranus and Neptune near-circular again.[46][70]<br>In contrast to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age of the Solar System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.[37]<br>Another question is why Mars came out so small compared with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the Grand tack hypothesis), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5 AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce the characteristics of the modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets.[71][72] However, it is unclear whether conditions in the solar nebula would have allowed Jupiter and Saturn to move back to their current positions, and according to current estimates this possibility appears unlikely.[73] Moreover, alternative explanations for the small mass of Mars exist.[74][75][76]<br><br>Late Heavy Bombardment and after[edit]<br>Main article: Late Heavy Bombardment<br>Meteor Crater in Arizona. Created 50,000 years ago by an impactor about 50 metres (160 ft) across, it shows that the accretion of the Solar System is not over.<br>Gravitational disruption from the outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass.[58] This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that is hypothesised to have occurred approximately 4 billion years ago, 500–600 million years after the formation of the Solar System.[2][77] However, a recent re-appraisal of the cosmo-chemical constraints indicates that there was likely no late spike (“terminal cataclysm”) in the bombardment rate.[78]<br>If it occurred, this period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and is evident in the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury.[2][79] The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8 billion years ago—almost immediately after the end of the Late Heavy Bombardment.[80]<br>Impacts are thought to be a regular (if currently infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact that created Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.[81][82]<br>Over the course of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets and sent thousands of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System.[83] The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.[84]<br>The evolution of the asteroid belt after Late Heavy Bombardment was mainly governed by collisions.[85] Objects with large mass have enough gravity to retain any material ejected by a violent collision. In the asteroid belt this usually is not the case. As a result, many larger objects have been broken apart, and sometimes newer objects have been forged from the remnants in less violent collisions.[85] Moons around some asteroids currently can only be explained as consolidations of material flung away from the parent object without enough energy to entirely escape its gravity.[86]<br><br>Moons[edit]<br>See also: Giant-impact hypothesis<br>Moons have come to exist around most planets and many other Solar System bodies. These natural satellites originated by one of three possible mechanisms:<br><br>Co-formation from a circumplanetary disc (only in the cases of the giant planets);<br>Formation from impact debris (given a large enough impact at a shallow angle); and<br>Capture of a passing object.<br>Artist's conception of the giant impact thought to have formed the Moon<br>Jupiter and Saturn have several large moons, such as Io, Europa, Ganymede and Titan, which may have originated from discs around each giant planet in much the same way that the planets formed from the disc around the Sun.[87][88][89] This origin is indicated by the large sizes of the moons and their proximity to the planet. These attributes are impossible to achieve via capture, while the gaseous nature of the primaries also makes formation from collision debris unlikely. The outer moons of the giant planets tend to be small and have eccentric orbits with arbitrary inclinations. These are the characteristics expected of captured bodies.[90][91] Most such moons orbit in the direction opposite to the rotation of their primary. The largest irregular moon is Neptune's moon Triton, which is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object.[82]<br>Moons of solid Solar System bodies have been created by both collisions and capture. Mars's two small moons, Deimos and Phobos, are thought to be captured asteroids.[92]<br>The Earth's Moon is thought to have formed as a result of a single, large head-on collision.[93][94]<br>The impacting object probably had a mass comparable to that of Mars, and the impact probably occurred near the end of the period of giant impacts. The collision kicked into orbit some of the impactor's mantle, which then coalesced into the Moon.[93] The impact was probably the last in a series of mergers that formed the Earth.<br>It has been further hypothesized that the Mars-sized object may have formed at one of the stable Earth–Sun Lagrangian points (either L4 or L5) and drifted from its position.[95] The moons of trans-Neptunian objects Pluto (Charon) and Orcus (Vanth) may also have formed by means of a large collision: the Pluto–Charon, Orcus–Vanth and Earth–Moon systems are unusual in the Solar System in that the satellite's mass is at least 1% that of the larger body.[96][97]<br><br>Future[edit]<br>Astronomers estimate that the current state of the Solar System will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. The Solar System will continue to evolve until then. Eventually, the Sun will likely expand sufficiently to overwhelm the inner planets (Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth) but not the outer planets, including Jupiter and Saturn. Afterward, the Sun would be reduced to the size of a white dwarf, and the outer planets and their moons would continue orbiting this diminutive solar remnant. This future development may be similar to the observed detection of MOA-2010-BLG-477L b, a Jupiter-sized exoplanet orbiting its host white dwarf star MOA-2010-BLG-477L.[98][99][100]<br><br>Long-term stability[edit]<br>Main article: Stability of the Solar System<br>The Solar System is chaotic over million- and billion-year timescales,[101] with the orbits of the planets open to long-term variations. One notable example of this chaos is the Neptune–Pluto system, which lies in a 3:2 orbital resonance. Although the resonance itself will remain stable, it becomes impossible to predict the position of Pluto with any degree of accuracy more than 10–20 million years (the Lyapunov time) into the future.[102] Another example is Earth's axial tilt, which, due to friction raised within Earth's mantle by tidal interactions with the Moon (see below), is incomputable from some point between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.[103]<br>The outer planets' orbits are chaotic over longer timescales, with a Lyapunov time in the range of 2–230 million years.[104]<br>In all cases, this means that the position of a planet along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer becomes uncertain). Still, in some cases, the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.[105]<br>Ultimately, the Solar System is stable in that none of the planets are likely to collide with each other or be ejected from the system in the next few billion years.[104] Beyond this, within five billion years or so, Mars's eccentricity may grow to around 0.2, such that it lies on an Earth-crossing orbit, leading to a potential collision. In the same timescale, Mercury's eccentricity may grow even further, and a close encounter with Venus could theoretically eject it from the Solar System altogether[101] or send it on a collision course with Venus or Earth.[106] This could happen within a billion years, according to numerical simulations in which Mercury's orbit is perturbed.[107]<br><br>Moon–ring systems[edit]<br>The evolution of moon systems is driven by tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.<br>The Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons)[108] and most of the larger moons of Saturn.[109]<br><br>Neptune and its moon Triton, taken by Voyager 2. Triton's orbit will eventually take it within Neptune's Roche limit, tearing it apart and possibly forming a new ring system.<br>A different scenario occurs when the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).[d] In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30 to 50 million years),[110] Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years),[111] and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.[112]<br>A third possibility is where the primary and moon are tidally locked to each other. In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no angular momentum transfer, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are an example of this type of configuration.[113]<br>There is no consensus on the mechanism of the formation of the rings of Saturn. Although theoretical models indicated that the rings were likely to have formed early in the Solar System's history,[114] data from the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft suggests they formed relatively late.[115]<br><br>The Sun and planetary environments[edit]<br>See also: Stellar evolution and Future of Earth

Specifically, controlled stratospheric aerosol injection appears able to greatly moderate most environmental impacts—especially warming—and consequently most ecological, economic, and other impacts of climate change across most regions. However, because warming from greenhouse gases and cooling from SRM would operate differently across latitudes and seasons, a world where global warming would be offset by SRM would have a different climate from the world where this warming did not occur in the first place, mainly as the result of an altered hydrological cycle. Furthermore, confidence in the current projections of how SRM would affect regional climate and ecosystems is low.[1]<br>SRM would pose environmental risks. In addition to its imperfect reduction of climate-change impacts, stratospheric aerosol injection could, for example, slow the recovery of stratospheric ozone. If a significant SRM intervention were to suddenly stop and not be resumed, the cooling would end relatively rapidly, posing serious environmental risks. Some environmental risks may remain unknown. <br>Governing SRM is challenging for multiple reasons, including that several countries would likely be capable of doing it alone.[2] For now, there is no formal international framework designed to regulate SRM, although aspects of existing international law would be applicable. The most common concern about SRM is that its research and evaluation might undermine reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Issues of governance and effectiveness are intertwined, as poorly governed use of SRM might lead to its highly suboptimal implementation. Thus, many questions regarding the acceptable deployment of SRM, or even its research and development, are currently unanswered.<br><br><br>At the 6th UN Environmental Assembly (UNEA 6) February/Mar 2024 in Nairobi, Switzerland failed for the second time with a proposal to hold a discussion on “Solar Radiation Management” (SRM) measures in an international body begin. There will still be no structured global debate on the possible use of geoengineering techniques. The countries mistrust each other and argue about the scope and aim of an investigation. Meanwhile, other actors are creating facts. The USA, Saudi Arabia and Japan spoke out against a generally accessible knowledge base at the multilateral level.[3]<br><br>Overview[edit]<br>SRM can be deployed on different scales. This graph shows the baseline radiative forcing under three different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, and how it would be affected by the deployment of SAI, starting from 2034, to either halve the speed of warming by 2100, to halt the warming, or to reverse it entirely.[4]<br>Averaged over the year and location, the Earth's atmosphere receives 340 W/m2 of solar irradiance from the sun.[5] Due to elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the net difference between the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth and the amount of energy radiated back to space has risen from 1.7 W/m2 in 1980, to 3.1 W/m2 in 2019.[6] This imbalance—called radiative forcing—means that the Earth absorbs more energy than it lets off, causing global temperatures to rise.[7]<br>Solar radiation modification (SRM) would increase Earth's ability to deflect sunlight, such as by increasing the albedo of the atmosphere or the surface. The goal of SRM would be to reduce radiative forcing by increasing Earth's albedo (reflectivity). An increase in planetary albedo of 1% would reduce radiative forcing by 2.35 W/m2, eliminating most of global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, while a 2% albedo increase would negate the warming effect of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration[8]<br>SRM methods include:[8]<br><br>Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), in which small particles would be injected into the upper atmosphere to cool the planet with both global dimming and increased albedo<br>Marine cloud brightening (MCB), which would spray fine sea water to whiten clouds and thus increase cloud reflectivity<br>Albedo enhancement, in which cool roofs and reflectors are would increase the albedo or reflectivity of the Earth's surface to deflect solar radiation back into space[9]<br>Cirrus cloud thinning (CCT), which is strictly not SRM but shares many of characteristics as the other methods.[10]<br>A 2023 report from the UN Environment Progamme concluded that "Modelling studies have consistently shown that climate change (in terms of temperature and hydrological metrics) in nearly all regions is much smaller with a carefully designed SRM deployment than in a world with continued climate change and without an SRM deployment."[11]<br>SRM's climatic effects would be rapid and reversible, which would bring the obvious advantage of speed but the serious disadvantage of sudden warming if it were to be stopped suddenly and not resumed.[12]<br><br>Potential roles[edit]<br>Regardless of the method used, there is a wide range of potential deployment scenarios for SRM, which differ both in the scale of warming they would offset and their target endpoint. <br>SRM is generally intended to complement, not replace, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal. For example, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report concurs: "There is high agreement in the literature that for addressing climate change risks SRM cannot be the main policy response to climate change and is, at best, a supplement to achieving sustained net zero or net negative CO2 emission levels globally".[1] However, SRM's actual role may differ from this, such as being used as an emergency response to sudden climate change impacts. <br>Initially, the majority of studies considered relatively extreme scenarios where modeled global emissions were very high and are offset with similarly high levels of SRM. In later years, research explored using SRM to partially offset global warming and aid to avoid failing the Paris Agreement goals of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and 2 °C (3.6 °F) or to halve warming.[13]<br><br>Potential complementary responses to climate change: greenhouse gas emissions abatement, carbon dioxide removal, SRM, and adaptation. Originally called the "napkin diagram" and drawn by John Shepherd.[14]<br>SRM's speed of effect gives it two potential roles in managing risks from climate change. First, if mitigation (that is, emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal) and adaptation continue to be insufficient, and/or if climate change impacts are severe due to greater-than-expected climate sensitivity, tipping points, or vulnerability, then SRM could reduce these unexpectedly severe impacts. In this way, the knowledge to implement SRM as a backup plan would serve as a sort of risk diversification or insurance. Second, SRM could be implemented along with aggressive mitigation and adaptation in order "buy time" by slowing the rate of climate change and/or to eliminate the worst climate impacts until net negative emissions reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. (See diagram.)<br>SRM has been suggested as a means of stabilizing regional climates. There have also been proposals to focus SRM at the poles, in order to combat sea level rise[15] or regional MCB in order to protect coral reefs from bleaching. However, there is low confidence about the ability to control geographical boundaries of the effect.[1]<br><br>History[edit]<br>In 1965, during the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, President's Science Advisory Committee delivered "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment", a landmark report which warned of the harmful effects of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and mentioned "deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes", including "raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth".[16] As early as 1974, Russian climatologist Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming ever became a serious threat, it could be countered with airplane flights in the stratosphere, burning sulfur to make aerosols that would reflect sunlight away.[17] Along with carbon dioxide removal, SRM was discussed jointly as "geoengineering" in a 1992 climate change report from the US National Academies.[18] The topic was essentially taboo in the climate science and policy communities until Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen published an influential scholarly paper in 2006.[19] Major reports by the Royal Society (2009),[8] the US National Academies (2015, 2021),[20][21] and the UN Environment Programme[11] followed.<br>As of 2018, total research funding worldwide remained modest, at less than 10 million US dollars annually.[22] Almost all research into SRM has to date consisted of computer modeling or laboratory tests,[23] and there are calls for more research funding as the science is poorly understood.[24][25] Major academic institutions, including Harvard University, have begun research into SRM,[26] with NOAA alone investing $22 million from 2019 to 2022, though few outdoor tests have been run to date.[27] The Degrees Initiative is a UK registered charity,[28] established to build capacity in developing countries to evaluate SRM.[29] The 2021 US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report recommended an initial investment into SRM research of $100–$200 million over five years.[25]<br><br>Evidence of effectiveness and impacts[edit]<br>Modeling evidence of the effect of greenhouse gases and SRM on average annual temperature (left column) and precipitation (right column).[30] The first row (a) is moderately high continued greenhouse gas emissions (RCP4.5) at the end of the century. The second row (b) is the same emissions scenario and time, with SRM to reduce global warming to 1.5 °C. The third row (c) is the same emissions scenario but in the near future, when global warming would be 1.5 °C, with no SRM. The similarity between the second and third rows suggests that SRM could reduce climate change reasonably well.<br>Climate models consistently indicate that a moderate magnitude of SRM would bring important aspects of the climate—for example, average and extreme temperature, water availability, cyclone intensity—closer to their preindustrial values at a subregional resolution.[13] (See figure.)<br><br>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in its Sixth Assessment Report:[31]: 69 .... SRM could offset some of the effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate, including the carbon and water cycles. However, there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scales and seasonal time scales, and large uncertainties associated with aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions persist. The cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO2 sinks, but this would not stop CO2 from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. It is likely that abrupt water cycle changes will occur if SRM techniques are implemented rapidly. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emission reduction and CDR would avoid these termination effects.The 2021 US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report states: "The available research indicates that SG could reduce surface temperatures and potentially ameliorate some risks posed by climate change (e.g., to avoid crossing critical climate 'tipping points'; to reduce harmful impacts of weather extremes)."[21]<br>SRM would imperfectly compensate for anthropogenic climate changes. Greenhouse gases warm throughout the globe and year, whereas SRM reflects light more effectively at low latitudes and in the hemispheric summer (due to the sunlight's angle of incidence) and only during daytime. Deployment regimes could compensate for this heterogeneity by changing and optimizing injection rates by latitude and season.[32][33]<br>In general, greenhouse gases warm the entire planet and are expected to change precipitation patterns heterogeneously, both spatially and temporally, with an overall increase in precipitation. Models indicate that SRM would compensate both of these changes but would do more effectively for temperature than for precipitation. Therefore, using SRM to fully return global mean temperature to a preindustrial level would overcorrect for precipitation changes. This has led to claims that it would dry the planet or even cause drought, but this would depend on the intensity (i.e. radiative forcing) of SRM. Furthermore, soil moisture is more important for plants than average annual precipitation. Because SRM would reduce evaporation, it more precisely compensates for changes to soil moisture than for average annual precipitation.[34] Likewise, the intensity of tropical monsoons is increased by climate change and decreased by SRM.[35] A net reduction in tropical monsoon intensity might manifest at moderate use of SRM, although to some degree the effect of this on humans and ecosystems would be mitigated by greater net precipitation outside of the monsoon system. This has led to claims that SRM "would disrupt the Asian and African summer monsoons", but the impact would depend on the particular implementation regime.<br>People are concerned about climate change largely because of its impacts on people and ecosystems. In the case of the former, agriculture is particularly important. A net increase in agricultural productivity from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and SRM has also been predicted by some studies due to the combination of more diffuse light and carbon dioxide's fertilization effect.[36] Other studies suggest that SRM would have little net effect on agriculture.[37] Understanding of SRM's effects on ecosystems remains at an early stage. Its reduction of climate change would generally help maintain ecosystems, although the resulting more diffuse incoming sunlight would favor undergrowth relative to canopy growth.<br><br>Advantages[edit]<br>The target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through a combination of emission cuts and carbon dioxide removal, after which global warming stops,[38] but the temperature will only go back down if we remove more carbon dioxide than we emit. SRM on the other hand could cool the planet within months after deployment,[20] thus can act to reduce climate risk while we cut emissions and scale up carbon dioxide removal.  Stratospheric aerosol injection is expected to have low direct financial costs of implementation,[39] relative to the expected costs of both unabated climate change and aggressive mitigation. Finally, the direct climatic effects of SRM are reversible within short timescales.[20]<br><br>Limitations and risks[edit]<br>As well as the imperfect cancellation of the climatic effect of greenhouse gases, described above, there are other significant problems with SRM.<br><br>Incomplete solution to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations[edit]<br>Change in sea surface pH caused by anthropogenic CO2 between the 1700s and the 1990s. This ocean acidification will still be a major problem unless atmospheric CO2 is reduced.<br>SRM does not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and thus does not reduce other effects from these gases, such as ocean acidification.[40] While not an argument against SRM per se, this is an argument against reliance on it to the exclusion of emissions reduction.<br><br>Uncertainty[edit]<br>Most of the information on SRM comes from climate models and volcanic eruptions, which are both imperfect analogues of stratospheric aerosol injection. The climate models used in impact assessments are the same that scientists use to predict the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Some uncertainties in these climate models (such as aerosol microphysics, stratospheric dynamics, and sub-grid scale mixing) are particularly relevant to SRM and are a target for future research.[41] Volcanoes are an imperfect analogue as they release the material in the stratosphere in a single pulse, as opposed to sustained injection.[42] Modelling is uncertain as little practical research has been done.[2]<br><br>Maintenance and termination shock[edit]<br>Climate models project that SRM interventions would take effect rapidly, but would also quickly fade out if not sustained. This means that their direct effects are effectively reversible, but also risks a rapid rebound after a prolonged interruption, sometimes known as termination shock. SRM effects would be temporary, and thus long-term climate restoration would rely on long-term deployment until sufficient carbon dioxide is removed.[43][44] If SRM masked significant warming, stopped abruptly, and was not resumed within a year or so, the climate would rapidly warm.[45] Global temperatures would rapidly rise towards levels which would have existed without the use of SRM. The rapid rise in temperature might lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude. However, some scholars have argued that this termination shock appears reasonably easy to prevent because it would be in states' interest to resume any terminated deployment regime; and because infrastructure and knowledge could be made redundant and resilient, allowing states to act on this interest and gradually phase out unwanted SRM.[46][47]<br>Some claim that SRM "would basically be impossible to stop."[48][49] This is true only of a long-term deployment strategy. A short-term, temporary strategy would limit implementation to decades.[50]<br><br>Disagreement and control[edit]<br>Although climate models of SRM rely on some optimal or consistent implementation, leaders of countries and other actors may disagree as to whether, how, and to what degree SRM be used. This could result in suboptimal deployments and exacerbate international tensions.[51]<br>Some observers claim that SRM is likely to be militarized or weaponized. However, weaponization is disputed because SRM would be imprecise.[52] Regardless, the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, which prohibits weaponizing SRM, came into force in 1978.[53]<br><br>Unwanted or premature use[edit]<br>There is a risk that countries may start using SRM without proper precaution or research. SRM, at least by stratospheric aerosol injection, appears to have low direct implementation costs relative to its potential impact. This creates a different problem structure.[54][55] Whereas the provision of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal present collective action problems (because ensuring a lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a public good), a single country or a handful of countries could implement SRM. Many countries have the financial and technical resources to undertake SRM.[2]<br>In 2000s, some have suggested that SRM could be within reach of a lone "Greenfinger", a wealthy individual who takes it upon him or herself to be the "self-appointed protector of the planet".[56][57] Others disagree and argue that states will insist on maintaining control of SRM.[58] Subsequent research had dimmed this notion, as the annual costs of around $18 billion per 1 °C (1.8 °F) of cooling are likely to be prohibitive for even the wealthiest individuals.[4]<br><br>Distribution of effects[edit]<br>Both climate change and SRM would affect various groups of people differently. Some observers describe SRM as necessarily creating "winners and losers". However, models indicate that SRM at a moderate intensity would return important climatic values of almost all regions of the planet closer to preindustrial conditions.[citation needed] That is, if all people prefer preindustrial conditions, such a moderate use could be a Pareto improvement.<br>Developing countries are particularly important, as they are more vulnerable to climate change. All else equal, they therefore have the most to gain from a judicious use of SRM. Observers sometimes claim that SRM poses greater risks to developing countries. There is no evidence that the unwanted environmental impacts of SRM would be significantly greater in developing countries, although potential disruptions to tropical monsoons are a concern. But in one sense, this claim of greater risk is true for the same reason that they are more vulnerable to greenhouse gas-induced climate change: developing countries have weaker infrastructure and institutions, and their economies rely to a greater degree on agriculture. They are thus more vulnerable to all climate changes, whether from greenhouse gases or SRM.<br><br>Lessened mitigation[edit]<br>The existence of SRM may reduce the political and social impetus for mitigation.[59] This has generally been called a potential "moral hazard", although risk compensation may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss SRM.[60] However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertion of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of SRM, or of no effect.[8][61][62][63][64][65][66] Likewise, some modelling work suggests that the threat of SRM may in fact increase the likelihood of emissions reduction.[67][68][69][70]<br><br>Effect on sky and clouds[edit]<br>Managing solar radiation using aerosols or cloud cover would involve changing the ratio between direct and indirect solar radiation. This would affect plant life[71] and solar energy.[72] Visible light, useful for photosynthesis, is reduced proportionally more than is the infrared portion of the solar spectrum due to the mechanism of Mie scattering.[73]  As a result, deployment of atmospheric SRM would reduce by at least 2–5% the growth rates of phytoplankton, trees, and crops [74] between now and the end of the century.[75] Uniformly reduced net shortwave radiation would hurt solar photovoltaics by the same 2–5% because of the bandgap of silicon photovoltaics.[76]<br><br>Proposed forms[edit]<br>Atmospheric[edit]<br>Stratospheric aerosol injection[edit]<br>Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering<br>Main article: Stratospheric aerosol injection<br>Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere is the proposed SRM method that has received the most sustained attention. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that Stratospheric aerosol injection "is the most-researched SRM method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5 °C."[77] This technique would mimic a cooling phenomenon that occurs naturally by the eruption of volcanoes.[78] Sulfates are the most commonly proposed aerosol, since there is a natural analogue with (and evidence from) volcanic eruptions. Alternative materials such as using photophoretic particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond have been proposed.[79][80][81][82][83] Delivery by custom aircraft appears most feasible, with artillery and balloons sometimes discussed.[84][85][86] The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at $5 to 10 billion US dollars.[87] This technique could give much more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is sufficient to entirely offset the warming caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide.<br><br>Marine cloud brightening[edit]<br>Main article: Marine cloud brightening<br>Various cloud reflectivity methods have been suggested, such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectivity of clouds.[89] The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray would change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter.[90] The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth.[91] The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect.<br>This technique can give more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is sufficient to reverse the warming effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.<br><br>Cirrus cloud thinning[edit]<br>Main article: Cirrus cloud thinning<br>Natural cirrus clouds are believed to have a net warming effect. These could be dispersed by the injection of various materials. This method is strictly not SRM, as it increases outgoing longwave radiation instead of decreasing incoming shortwave radiation. However, because it shares some of the physical and especially governance characteristics as the other SRM methods, it is often included.[92]<br><br>Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement[edit]<br>Main article: Ocean fertilization<br>Enhancing the natural marine sulfur cycle by fertilizing a small portion with iron—typically considered to be a greenhouse gas remediation method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight.[93][94] Such fertilization, especially in the Southern Ocean, would enhance dimethyl sulfide production and consequently cloud reflectivity. This could potentially be used as regional SRM, to slow Antarctic ice from melting.[citation needed] Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.<br><br>Terrestrial[edit]<br>Cool roof[edit]<br>The albedo of several types of roofs (lower = hotter)<br>Main article: Reflective surfaces (climate engineering)<br>Painting roof materials in white or pale colors to reflect solar radiation, known as 'cool roof' technology, is encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California).[95] This technique is limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the constrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01 and 0.19 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated.[88] This is small relative to the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Moreover, while in small cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials, it can be costly if implemented on a larger scale. A 2009 Royal Society report states that, "the overall cost of a 'white roof method' covering an area of 1% of the land surface (about 1012 m2) would be about $300 billion/yr, making this one of the least effective and most expensive methods considered."[8] However, it can reduce the need for air conditioning, which emits carbon dioxide and contributes to global warming.<br><br>Radiative cooling[edit]<br>Some papers have proposed the deployment of specific thermal emitters (whether via advanced paint, or printed rolls of material) which would simultaneously reflect sunlight and also emit energy at longwave infrared (LWIR) lengths of 8–20 μm, which is too short to be trapped by the greenhouse effect and would radiate into outer space. It has been suggested that to stabilize Earth's energy budget and thus cease warming, 1–2% of the Earth's surface (area equivalent to over half of Sahara) would need to be covered with these emitters, at the deployment cost of $1.25 to $2.5 trillion. While low next to the estimated $20 trillion saved by limiting the warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) rather than 2 °C (3.6 °F), it does not include any maintenance costs.[96][97]<br><br>Ocean and ice changes[edit]<br>Oceanic foams have also been suggested, using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the photic zone. A less costly proposal is to simply lengthen and brighten existing ship wakes.[98]<br>Arctic sea ice formation could be increased by pumping deep cooler water to the surface.[99] Sea ice (and terrestrial) ice can be thickened by increasing albedo with silica spheres.[100] Glaciers flowing into the sea may be stabilized by blocking the flow of warm water to the glacier.[101] Salt water could be pumped out of the ocean and snowed onto the West Antarctic ice sheet.[102][103]<br><br>Vegetation[edit]<br>Reforestation in tropical areas has a cooling effect. Changes to grassland have been proposed to increase albedo.[104] This technique can give 0.64 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of carbon dioxide, but could make a minor contribution. Selecting or genetically modifying commercial crops with high albedo has been suggested.[105] This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, with farmers simply switching from one variety to another. Temperate areas may experience a 1 °C cooling as a result of this technique.[106] This technique is an example of bio-geoengineering. This technique can give 0.44 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of carbon dioxide, but could make a minor contribution.<br><br>Space-based[edit]<br>The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. The image is simplified, as a 1000 kilometre diameter lens is considered sufficient by most proposals, and would be much smaller than shown. Additionally, a zone plate would only be a few nanometers thick.<br>Main articles: Space sunshade and Space mirror (climate engineering)<br>There has been a range of proposals to reflect or deflect solar radiation from space, before it even reaches the atmosphere, commonly described as a space sunshade.[80] The most straightforward is to have mirrors orbiting around the Earth—an idea first suggested even before the wider awareness of climate change, with rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth considering it a way to facilitate terraforming projects in 1923.[107] and this was followed by other books in 1929, 1957 and 1978.[108][109][110] By 1992, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences described a plan to suspend 55,000 mirrors with an individual area of 100 square meters in a Low Earth orbit.[8] Another contemporary plan was to use space dust to replicate Rings of Saturn around the equator, although a large number of satellites would have been necessary to prevent it from dissipating. A 2006 variation on this idea suggested relying entirely on a ring of satellites electromagnetically tethered in the same location. In all cases, sunlight exerts pressure which can displace these reflectors from orbit over time, unless stabilized by enough mass. Yet, higher mass immediately drives up launch costs.[8]<br>In an attempt to deal with this problem, other researchers have proposed Inner lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun as an alternative to near-Earth orbits, even though this tends to increase manufacturing or delivery costs instead. In 1989, a paper suggested founding a lunar colony, which would produce and deploy diffraction grating made out of a hundred million tonnes of glass.[111] In 1997, a single, very large mesh of aluminium wires "about one millionth of a millimetre thick" was also proposed.[112][self-published source?] Two other proposals from the early 2000s advocated the use of thin metallic disks 50–60 cm in diameter, which would either be launched from the Earth at a rate of once per minute over several decades, or be manufactured from asteroids directly in orbit.[8] When summarizing these options in 2009, the Royal Society concluded that their deployment times are measured in decades and costs in the trillions of USD, meaning that they are "not realistic potential contributors to short-term, temporary measures for avoiding dangerous climate change", and may only be competitive with the other geoengineering approaches when viewed from a genuinely long (a century or more) perspective, as the long lifetime of L1-based approaches could make them cheaper than the need to continually renew atmospheric-based measures over that timeframe.[8]<br>Relatively few researchers have revisited the subject since that Royal Society review, as it became accepted that space-based approaches would cost about 1000 times more than their terrestrial alternatives.[113] In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report had discussed SAI, MCB, CCT and even attempts to alter albedo on the ground or in the ocean, yet completely ignored space-based approaches.[1] There are still some proponents, who argue that unlike stratospheric aerosol injection, space-based approaches are advantageous because they do not interfere directly with the biosphere and ecosystems.[114] After the IPCC report was published, three astronomers have revisited the space dust concept, instead advocating for a lunar colony which would continuously mine the Moon in order to eject lunar dust into space on a trajectory where it would interfere with sunlight streaming towards the Earth. Ejections would have to be near-continuous, as since the dust would scatter in a matter of days, and about 10 million tons would have to be dug out and launched annually.[115] The authors admit that they lack a background in either climate or rocket science, and the proposal may not be logistically feasible.[116]<br>In 2021, researchers in Sweden considered building solar sails in the near-Earth orbit, which would then arrive to L1 point over 600 days one by one. Once they all form an array in situ, the combined 1.5 billion sails would have total area of 3.75 million square kilometers, while their combined mass is estimated in a range between 83 million tons (present-day technology) and 34 million tons (optimal advancements). This proposal would cost between five and ten trillion dollars, but only once launch cost has been reduced to US$50/kg, which represents a massive reduction from the present-day costs of $4400-$2700/kg[117] for the most widely used launch vehicles.[118] In July 2022, a pair of researchers from MIT Senseable City Lab, Olivia Borgue and Andreas M. Hein, have instead proposed integrating nanotubes made out of silicon dioxide into ultra-thin polymeric films (described as "space bubbles" in the media [114]), whose semi-transparent nature would allow them to resist the pressure of solar wind at L1 point better than any alternative with the same weight. The use of these "bubbles" would limit the mass of a distributed sunshade roughly the size of Brazil to about 100,000 tons, much lower than the earlier proposals. However, it would still require between 399 and 899 yearly launches of a vehicle such as SpaceX Starship for a period of around 10 years, even though the production of the bubbles themselves would have to be done in space. The flights would not begin until research into production and maintenance of these bubbles is completed, which the authors estimate would require a minimum of 10–15 years. After that, the space shield may be large enough by 2050 to prevent crossing of the 2 °C (3.6 °F) threshold.[113][114][119]<br><br>Governance[edit]<br>The governance of SRM contains many relevant aspects. The potential use of SRM poses several challenges because of its high leverage, low apparent direct costs, and technical feasibility as well as issues of power and jurisdiction.[120]  Because international law is generally consensual, this creates a challenge of widespread participation being required. Key issues include who will have control over the deployment of SRM and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. A governance framework for SRM must be sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over a long period of time and yet be flexible as information is acquired, the techniques evolve, and interests change through time.<br>Some researchers have suggested that building a global agreement on SRM deployment will be very difficult, and instead power blocs are likely to emerge.[121] There are, however, significant incentives for states to cooperate in choosing a specific SRM policy, which make unilateral deployment a rather unlikely event.[122]<br>Other relevant aspects of the governance of SRM include supporting research, ensuring that it is conducted responsibly, regulating the roles of the private sector and (if any) the military, public engagement, setting and coordinating research priorities, undertaking trusted scientific assessment, building trust, and compensating for possible harms. <br>In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released their consensus study report Recommendations for Solar Geoengineering Research and Research Governance, concluding:[21]<br><br>[A] strategic investment in research is needed to enhance policymakers' understanding of climate response options. The United States should develop a transdisciplinary research program, in collaboration with other nations, to advance understanding of solar geoengineering's technical feasibility and effectiveness, possible impacts on society and the environment, and social dimensions such as public perceptions, political and economic dynamics, and ethical and equity considerations. The program should operate under robust research governance that includes such elements as a research code of conduct, a public registry for research, permitting systems for outdoor experiments, guidance on intellectual property, and inclusive public and stakeholder engagement processes.<br>Politics[edit]<br>There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, SRM has become a very political issue.<br>There is no meaningful advocacy for the use of SRM. (However, a small start-up business, Make Sunsets, sells "cooling credits" to launch balloons with helium and sulfur dioxide.[123] Many advocates of SRM research have condemned this undertaking.) The most salient political issues thus regard research. <br>As noted above, the governance of SRM will necessarily be international. Few countries have an explicit governmental position on SRM. Most of those that do, such as the United Kingdom[124] and Germany,[125] support SRM research. Other countries, such as the U.S., Germany, China, Finland, Norway, and Japan, as well as the European Union, have funded SRM research.[126] In contrast, Mexico announced that it will prohibit "experimental practices with solar geoengineering",[127] although it remains unclear what this policy will include and whether the policy has actually been implemented. Other countries have expressed a range of views at intergovernmental forums such as the UN Environment Assembly.<br>Support for SRM research comes almost entirely from those who are concerned about climate change. The leading argument is that the risks of likely anthropogenic climate change are great and imminent enough to warrant research and evaluation of a wide range of responses, even one with limitations and risks of its own. Leading this effort have been some climate scientists (such as James Hansen), some of whom ave endorsed one or both public letters that support further SRM research.[128][129] Scientific organizations that have called for further research include the World Climate Research Programme,[130] the Royal Society,[8] the US National Academies,[20][21] the American Geophysical Union,[131] the American Meteorological Society, the U.S. Global Change Research Program,[132] the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (UK),[133] Australia's Office of the Chief Scientist,[134] and the Netherlands' scientific assessment institute.[135] Reports from the UN Environment Programme,[11] the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,[136] and the Council on Foreign Relations[137] have likewise called for further SRM research, as have a handful of relatively moderate American environmental nongovernmental organizations (Environmental Defense Fund, Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Natural Resources Defense Council).  <br>A few nongovernmental organizations actively support SRM research and governance dialogues. The Degrees Initiative works toward "changing the global environment in which SRM is evaluated, ensuring informed and confident representation from developing countries."[138] Among other activities, it provides grants to scientists in the Global South. SilverLining is an American organization that advances SRM research as part of "climate interventions to reduce near-term climate risks and impacts."[139] The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering advances "just and inclusive deliberation" regarding SRM.[140] The Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative catalyzed governance of SRM and carbon dioxide removal,[141] although it ended operations in 2023.<br>Some critics claim that political conservatives, opponents of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and fossil fuel firms are major advocates of SRM research.[142][143] However, only a handful of conservatives and opponents of climate action have expressed support, and there is no evidence that fossil fuel firms are involved in SRM research.[144] In fact, most conservative commentary on SRM has dismissed it as a radical but unnecessary response to the minor problem of climate change.[145] Instead, claims of fossil-fuel industry support typically conflate SRM and carbon dioxide removal—where fossil fuel firms are involved—under the broader term "geoengineering".<br>Opposition to SRM research has largely come from opponents of emerging technologies, green environmental groups, and some academics, mostly from the social science and humanities but counting a few climate scientists. Each of these constituencies includes substantial socialist shares, which call also for a global redistribution of power and wealth. Their leading arguments are that SRM research would lessen cuts to greenhouse gas emissions (and consequently prevent desired socio-economic transformations), that SRM would be impossible to govern, that it would be too risky, and that it would necessarily be unjust. The radical anti-technology organization the ETC Group has been the pioneer in opposing SRM research,[146] and was later joined by the Heinrich Böll Foundation[147] (affiliated with the German Green Party) and the Center for International Environmental Law.[148] In 2022, a dozen academics launched a political campaign for national policies of "no public funding, no outdoor experiments, no patents, no deployment, and no support in international institutions... including in assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."[149] The proponents call this a "non-use agreement", but others have asserted that these five policies, if enacted, would end all meaningful SRM research. The campaign has been endorsed by a few hundred fellow academics and environmental groups.[150] Among the latter is the Climate Action Network, a coalition of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations. (The position from Climate Action Network included a footnote that excluded the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council.[151])<br>In 2021, researchers at Harvard put plans for a SRM test on hold after Indigenous Sámi people objected to the test taking place in their homeland.[152][153] Although the test would not have involved any atmospheric experiments, members of the Saami Council spoke out against the lack of consultation and SRM more broadly. Speaking at a panel organized by the Center for International Environmental Law and other groups, Saami Council Vice President Åsa Larsson Blind said, "This goes against our worldview that we as humans should live and adapt to nature."<br>The Climate Overshoot Commission is an group of global, eminent, and independent figures. It investigated and developed a comprehensive strategy to reduce climate risks which includes SRM in its policy portfolio.[154] The Commission's recommendation regarding SRM are:<br><br>"a moratorium on the deployment of solar radiation modification (SRM) and large-scale outdoor experiments...<br>governance of SRM research should be expanded...<br>SRM research should also be strengthened...<br>an international, independent scientific review and assessment of the best available evidence from SRM research should take place every few years...<br>broad consultations and dialogues on these issues are needed."[155]<br>Public attitudes[edit]<br>There have been a handful of studies into attitudes to and opinions of SRM. These generally find low levels of awareness, uneasiness with the implementation of SRM, cautious support of research, and a preference for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.[156][157] As is often the case with public opinions regarding emerging issues, the responses are highly sensitive to the questions' particular wording and context. Although most public opinion studies have polled residents of developed countries, those that have examined residents of developing countries—which tend to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts—find slightly greater levels of support there.[158][159][160] In fact, the largest assessment of public opinion and perception of SRM, which had over 30,000 respondents in 30 countries, found that "that Global South publics are significantly more favorable about potential benefits and express greater support for climate-intervention technologies."[161]<br><br>See also[edit]<br><br>Global warming portalEcology portalEnvironment portal<br>Climate engineering<br>Cloud seeding<br>Passive daytime radiative cooling<br>Weather Modification Operations and Research Board<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ a b c d Trisos, Christopher H.; Geden, Oliver; Seneviratne, Sonia I.; Sugiyama, Masahiro; van Aalst, Maarten; Bala, Govindasamy; Mach, Katharine J.; Ginzburg, Veronika; de Coninck, Heleen; Patt, Anthony.

This enables us to reproduce phenomena such as baroclinic cyclone and anticyclone weather systems, familiar from weather maps, in a rotating tank only 20-50 cm across. This also helps when applying results and insights from laboratory experiments to understanding phenomena observed in the atmospheres or oceans of the Earth or other planets.

A land-ocean pattern like that above was used in a climate model to show how storm clouds could have shielded ancient Venus from strong sunlight and made the planet habitable.NASA.Venus may have had a shallow liquid-water ocean and habitable surface temperatures for up to 2 billion years of its early history, according to computer modeling of the planet’s ancient climate by scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York.The findings, published this week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, were obtained with a model similar to the type used to predict future climate change on Earth.“Many of the same tools we use to model climate change on Earth can be adapted to study climates on other planets, both past and present,” said Michael Way, a researcher at GISS and the paper’s lead author. “These results show ancient Venus may have been a very different place than it is today.”Venus today is a hellish world. It has a crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere 90 times as thick as Earth’s. There is almost no water vapor. Temperatures reach 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius) at its surface.Scientists long have theorized that Venus formed out of ingredients similar to Earth’s, but followed a different evolutionary path. Measurements by NASA’s Pioneer mission to Venus in the 1980s first suggested Venus originally may have had an ocean. However, Venus is closer to the sun than Earth and receives far more sunlight. As a result, the planet’s early ocean evaporated, water-vapor molecules were broken apart by ultraviolet radiation, and hydrogen escaped to space. With no water left on the surface, carbon dioxide built up in the atmosphere, leading to a so-called runaway greenhouse effect that created present conditions.Previous studies have shown that how fast a planet spins on its axis affects whether it has a habitable climate. A solar day on Venus is 117 Earth days (a sidereal day on Venus is 243 Earth days). Until recently, it was assumed that a thick atmosphere like that of modern Venus was required for the planet to have today’s slow rotation rate. However, newer research has shown that a thin atmosphere like that of modern Earth could have produced the same result. That means an ancient Venus with an Earth-like atmosphere could have had the same rotation rate it has today.Another factor that impacts a planet’s climate is topography. The GISS team postulated ancient Venus had more dry land overall than Earth, especially in the tropics. That limits the amount of water evaporated from the oceans and, as a result, the greenhouse effect by water vapor. This type of surface appears ideal for making a planet habitable; there seems to have been enough water to support abundant life, with sufficient land to reduce the planet’s sensitivity to changes from incoming sunlight.Way and his GISS colleagues simulated conditions of a hypothetical early Venus with an atmosphere similar to Earth’s, a day as long as Venus’ current day, and a shallow ocean consistent with early data from the Pioneer spacecraft. The researchers added information about Venus’ topography from radar measurements taken by NASA’s Magellan mission in the 1990s, and filled the lowlands with water, leaving the highlands exposed as Venusian continents. The study also factored in an ancient sun that was up to 30 percent dimmer. Even so, ancient Venus still received about 40 percent more sunlight than Earth does today.“In the GISS model’s simulation, Venus’ slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time,” co-author and fellow GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said. “This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heating. The result is mean climate temperatures that are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.”The research was done as part of NASA’s Planetary Science Astrobiology program through the Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) program, which seeks to accelerate the search for life on planets orbiting other stars, or exoplanets, by combining insights from the fields of astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, and Earth science. The findings have direct implications for future NASA missions, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and James Webb Space Telescope, which will try to detect possible habitable planets and characterize their atmospheres.Related linksRead the paper in Geophysical Research LettersNASA GISS' NExSS activitiesNASA GISS websiteShareDetailsLast UpdatedMar 18, 2024EditorNASA Science Editorial Team Related TermsCarbon CycleClimate ChangeExplore More3 min readNASA Data Helps Beavers Build Back StreamsHumans aren’t the only mammals working to mitigate the effects of climate change in the Western United States.
