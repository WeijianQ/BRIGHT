# Query `101`

## Original Question

*Quite simply what is the highest point above sea level that is right on the equator, I figured it would be a mountain in the Ecuadorian Andes but the Kenyan highlands look to be a likely candidate as well. I've tried to find it but I simply can't find a map that has the equator and the altitude in a highly accurate format and resolution anywhere.*

The essential problem you're facing is identifying the highest point above sea level that is directly on the equator. This involves considering geographical features that intersect with the equator and assessing their elevations. Let's break down the steps to address this question:

### 1. Identify Geographic Features Along the Equator
The equator passes through several countries and geographic features, including oceans, rainforests, and mountain ranges. Specifically, it crosses South America (Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil), Africa (Gabon, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Kenya, and Somalia), and Asia (Indonesia). Among these, the most likely candidates for the highest point would be in mountainous regions, which brings us to the Ecuadorian Andes and the Kenyan highlands, as you've mentioned.

### 2. Consider the Ecuadorian Andes
The Ecuadorian Andes are known for having some of the world's highest volcanoes and mountain peaks. The equator runs very close to some of these high peaks. One significant peak to consider is the Cayambe volcano. Cayambe is the third highest mountain in Ecuador and is notable because it's the highest point directly on the equator. Its summit is about 5,790 meters (18,996 feet) above sea level. This makes it a strong candidate for the highest point on the equator.

### 3. Look at the Kenyan Highlands
The Kenyan highlands, while also featuring significant elevations, are generally not as high as the peaks in the Andes. Mount Kenya, the highest peak in Kenya and the second-highest in Africa, lies just south of the equator and its peak does not cross the equatorial line. Therefore, while the highlands have substantial elevations, they do not offer a point that directly intersects the equator at an altitude higher than Cayambe.

### 4. Analyze Other Regions
Other equatorial regions, such as the Congo Basin and the Amazon Rainforest, are not known for high mountain peaks like those in the Andes. Indonesia's Sumatra and Borneo, crossed by the equator, also have mountains and highlands but none that reach the elevations found in the Andes.

### Conclusion
Based on the available information, the highest point above sea level directly on the equator is Cayambe volcano in Ecuador. Its peak is about 5,790 meters (18,996 feet) above sea level, making it the most likely candidate for this distinction. This conclusion is supported by the fact that other equatorial regions, while possibly high, do not reach the elevations found in the Ecuadorian Andes, especially at the precise location where the equator crosses.

> part7 -------------------<br>Effect on climate[edit]<br>The East African Rift system affects regional, continental and even global climate. Regions of higher elevation, including the Ethiopian Highlands and the Kenya Highlands are hotspots of higher rainfall amid the semi-arid to arid lowlands of East Africa. Lakes which form within the rift, including Lake Victoria, have a large effect on regional climate. They are a source of water vapour, and also lead to the formation of lake breeze systems, which affect weather across large areas of East Africa. The east to west river valleys within the rift system, including the Turkana Channel in northern Kenya and the Zambezi river valley, concentrate low-level easterly winds and accelerate them towards Central Africa. This leaves East Africa drier than it otherwise would be, and also supports the high rainfall in the Congo Basin rainforest. The formation of the east-west valleys could in turn be important for the aridification of East Africa over millions of years.<br>The barrier presented by EARS concentrates monsoonal winds (known as the Somali Jet) in the western Indian Ocean. The Somali Jet supplies water vapour for the high rainfall during the Indian Monsoon and is responsible for roughly half the global cross-equatorial atmospheric mass flux in the lower-branch of Hadley Circulation.
