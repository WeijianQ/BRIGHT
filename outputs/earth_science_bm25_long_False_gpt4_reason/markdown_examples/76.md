## Original Question

*I am following the paper to calculate UTCI using ERA5 meteorological variables.

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-020-01900-5?shared-article-renderer

In the paper, the authors have mentioned that they are using ERA5 product. And specifically mentioned to use the direct and diffuse component of shortwave (SW) radiation.

The problem is, ERA5 data does not provide the direct and diffuse SW separately. Rather it only provides Surface solar radiation downwards which includes both the direct and diffuse component.

My question would be, is there a way to calculate the direct and diffuse component of SW from ERA5. The dataset I have is similar to ERA5 and has the Downward SW and Net SW. I have no problem in obtaining the Long waves BTW.

Any help would be much appreciated. TIA*

The essential problem you're facing is the need to calculate or estimate the direct and diffuse components of shortwave (SW) radiation using ERA5 data, which only provides the combined or total surface solar radiation downwards (i.e., it includes both the direct and diffuse components together). This issue arises in the context of applying the UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index) model that requires these separate components for accurate calculation.

To address this problem, here are several steps and considerations that might help:

### 1. Understanding the Components of Solar Radiation
First, it's important to understand what we mean by direct and diffuse solar radiation:
- **Direct solar radiation** is sunlight that directly reaches the Earth's surface without being scattered.
- **Diffuse solar radiation** is sunlight that has been scattered by molecules and particles in the atmosphere and reaches the Earth's surface from various directions.

### 2. Investigating Existing Literature and Studies
Before trying to create a method from scratch, investigate existing scientific literature and studies. Sometimes, researchers have developed models or methods to estimate these components from total solar radiation. These methods can involve empirical relationships that consider factors like the sun's position, atmospheric conditions, and total solar radiation.

### 3. Utilizing the Clearness Index
One approach might involve the clearness index, which is a ratio of the actual solar radiation received on the surface to the theoretical solar radiation outside the Earth's atmosphere. This index can help in estimating the proportion of direct to diffuse radiation under different atmospheric conditions.

### 4. Applying Empirical Models
Several empirical models and formulas have been developed to estimate direct and diffuse radiation from total solar radiation. These models often require additional data, such as atmospheric clarity, the angle of the sun, and geographical location. It's worth exploring these models to see if any can be adapted to work with ERA5 data and the additional information you have.

### 5. Considering the Net SW Radiation
You mentioned having access to Net SW radiation data as well. Net SW radiation is the difference between incoming and outgoing SW radiation at the surface. While this alone might not directly help in separating the direct and diffuse components, in combination with total downward SW radiation, it could provide additional insights or constraints for models attempting to estimate the direct and diffuse components.

### 6. Consulting with Experts or Communities
Consider reaching out to meteorological or climatological research communities, forums, or experts in the field. They might have encountered similar issues or could offer insights or unpublished methods to tackle this problem.

### 7. Exploring Data Repositories or Alternative Datasets
While ERA5 might not provide these components separately, other datasets or enhanced versions of ERA5 might offer them. It's worth exploring data repositories or contacting the data providers to see if there are alternative datasets that meet your requirements.

### Conclusion
While directly calculating or separating the direct and diffuse components of SW radiation from ERA5 data as provided might not be straightforward, the combination of understanding the theoretical underpinnings, exploring existing models, and possibly consulting with the scientific community could lead to a viable solution. Each of these steps involves its own challenges and would require further detailed investigation to determine the best approach for your specific application and data availability.

Discuss.: 26 June 2013<br>Revised: 6 November 2013 – Accepted: 30 December 2013 – Published: 21 February 2014<br>Abstract. Simulation of land surface processes is problematic in heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution<br>required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability<br>caused by, for example, topography, and the lack of accurate<br>meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required.<br>Gridded data products produced by atmospheric models can<br>fill this gap, however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations. In this study we<br>describe a method that uses the well-resolved description<br>of the atmospheric column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs),<br>to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale<br>subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide highresolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM).<br>The method makes use of an interpolation of pressurelevel data according to topographic height of the subgrid.<br>An elevation and topography correction is used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity<br>at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative<br>humidity fields to describe variability with elevation. Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach.<br>We test the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level<br>data and a set of reference methods, against a large evaluation<br>dataset (up to 210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps.<br>We demonstrate that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in complex terrain, with most significant<br>improvements (with respect to reference methods) seen in<br>variables derived from pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and incoming long-wave radiation.<br>This method may be of use in improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are not possible, due to lack<br>of observations (i.e. remote areas or future periods).<br>1 Introduction<br>Simulations of land-surface processes are important for performing assessments of a wide range of earth systems, under current and possible future climates. This task is problematic in complex terrain due to the inter-connected problems of (i) the high resolution required of model grids to<br>capture strong lateral variability caused by, for example, topography, surface or sub-surface processes (e.g. Gubler et al.,<br>2011; Riseborough et al., 2008; Arnold and Rees, 2009); and<br>consequently, (ii) the lack of accurate meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required (Thornton et al.,<br>1997; Liston and Elder, 2006). This can be due to the lack of<br>meteorological observations (i.e. spatial coverage, temporal<br>extent/continuity, or variables measured are insufficient for<br>purpose) or lack of representative observations where surface variability is high. Gridded data products produced by<br>atmospheric models can, in part, fill this gap (e.g. Frauenfeld, 2005; Pereira-Cardenal et al., 2011; Akhtar et al., 2009;<br>Vu et al., 2012); however, in many cases not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations (i.e.<br>site scale), and therefore require some form of downscaling<br>of variables.<br>Basic downscaling approaches (also referred to as disaggregation), utilise fixed relationships between the coarsegrid fields of atmospheric models and a subgrid surface,<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>388 J. Fiddes and S. Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain<br>that describes a given variable at higher resolution than the<br>coarse-grid. Such approaches developed from the recognised<br>need to represent subgrid surface heterogeneity in climate<br>models and therefore the requirement to disaggregate the<br>coarse-grid climate forcing to the subgrid land-surface (e.g.<br>Dickinson et al., 1986; Wood, 1992; Koster and Suarez,<br>1992; Seth et al., 1994). For example, Giorgi et al. (2003)<br>and Dimri (2009) downscale the temperature field according<br>to the subgrid elevation and a fixed lapse rate. In a coupled<br>system it is important that the coarse-grid mean is conserved<br>by such approaches (Giorgi et al., 2003). More complex approaches to downscaling of climate data can be broadly divided into dynamical or statistical methods (Schmidli et al.,<br>2007) which are used to increase the resolution of largescale climate fields (see for full discussion Wilby and Wigley<br>(1997)). Dynamical methods achieve this by using a limited<br>area model at a higher grid resolution e.g. a regional climate model (RCM), to simulate fine-scale processes which<br>are consistent with large-scale climate fields (Giorgi, 2006).<br>While an RCM grid resolution could be increased further, in<br>practice the effective resolution is limited by the complexity<br>of the numerics that must be solved at each model time step,<br>to the order of 101 km (Kotlarski and Block, 2005). Statistical<br>methods derive empirical relationships between large-scale<br>predictor fields and local observations (Maraun and Wetterhall, 2010). These methods are computationally efficient<br>but the coverage and effective resolution is often limited by<br>the density of observations, especially in mountainous (i.e.<br>data-poor) areas. Additionally, it is unknown whether empirically derived relationships are valid outside the time window used for calibration. To compliment these approaches<br>there is a growing number of physically inspired, computationally efficient approaches that use physical relationships<br>and high-resolution surface information, that is, digital elevation models (DEMs), to distribute fine-scale forcings (meteorological stations or coarse-grid centre point) over wide<br>areas (e.g. Liston and Elder, 2006; Tarboton and Luce, 1996;<br>Marks et al., 1999; Jarosch et al., 2012). These distributed<br>forcings can then be used for full 2-D, point scale or lumped<br>model simulations.<br>Another interesting statistical approach presented by<br>Schomburg et al. (2012) utilises empirical relationships between the atmospheric coarse field and high-resolution surface data to disaggregate variables. The main aim of this<br>work was to improve the forcing of soil–vegetation transfer<br>models either in offline simulations or fully coupled model<br>systems. However, the emphasis of this work is on improving the representation of the land surface, via a distributed<br>forcing, within climate models; moreover, the scheme resolution of 400 m would be too coarse to resolve many surface<br>processes in mountain areas.<br>In complex terrain, topography-based gradients of meteorological variables (i.e. related to elevation, aspect, slope,<br>etc.) can often dominate over horizontal gradients (i.e. latitude/longitude) within a region that is of comparable size<br>to a typical coarse climate cell (e.g. 50–100 km). An example of a method that has successfully encoded this assumption is the PRISM framework (parameter–elevation regressions on independent slopes model) which provides a statistical, topography-based mapping of climate observations<br>(Daly et al., 1994, 2002). We do not neglect the fact that<br>other forms of heterogeneity may be important in modifying surface fluxes, such as surface cover, but it is important<br>to distinguish between surface heterogeneity that clearly affects atmospheric forcing, e.g. the effect of elevation on air<br>temperature, and those characteristics that become important<br>when performing a coupled land-surface–atmosphere simulation (e.g. the effect of soil properties on near-surface air<br>temperature).<br>Climate models provide spatially and temporally continuous fields which are physically consistent and therefore are<br>useful tools for forcing regional-scale land-surface studies<br>(Machguth et al., 2009; Kotlarski et al., 2010). In addition,<br>they provide a thorough description of the atmospheric column by providing data fields at many pressure levels between<br>the earth’s surface and top of the atmosphere.<br>The aim of this study is to develop methods that use<br>the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column<br>provided by climate models, together with high-resolution<br>DEMs, to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a finescale subgrid. The main motivation of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model<br>(LSM), understood here as any process-based surface model<br>that simulates the interface of the land surface/subsurface–<br>atmosphere system. Additionally, the approach should be<br>consistent (methodologically, spatially, temporally) and not<br>reliant on observations. Therefore, the design criteria for this<br>method are (1) it provides high-resolution (< 100 m) downscaling of climate data based primarily on DEM-based information; (2) it is as physically based as possible and therefore has minimal reliance on observations and likely remains<br>valid under future conditions; (3) it employs simple methods<br>which are computationally efficient; (4) it may be used as<br>part of a modelling chain with a lumped representation of the<br>subgrid domain (e.g. Fiddes and Gruber, 2012) for large area<br>applications, as well as 1-D points and 2-D grids. Our approach therefore largely assumes vertical gradients to dominate horizontal gradients within a given model grid box. In<br>this study, we describe this method and its application with<br>ERA-Interim data, a 4-D-VAR reanalysis (3rd generation)<br>which uses the ECMWF climate model, although the method<br>could be equally used with other reanalyses (e.g. NARR,<br>NCEP/NCAR, JRA-55, NASA MERRA, or RCM derived<br>fields). Our methods are then evaluated against a large number of observations over a wide area of complex terrain in<br>the European Alps as well as compared to a set of reference<br>methods. The methods proposed here aim to provide an alternative to statistical methods when observations are not available (remote areas or future periods) and be complimentary<br>Geosci.

The ERA-Interim data assimilation system contains many improvements both in the forecasting model and<br>analysis methodology relative to ECMWF’s previous reanalysis, ERA-40, including the use of 4-dimensional variational analysis, a revised humidity analysis, the use of variational bias correction for satellite data, and other improvements in data handling (Dee et al., 2011). ERA-I provides<br>meteorological data from 1 January 1979 and continues to<br>be extended in near-real time. Gridded products include<br>a large variety of 3-hourly (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00,<br>15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 UTC) grid-surface fields (GRID)<br>and 6-hourly (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC) upperatmosphere products available on 60 pressure levels (PL)<br>with top of the atmosphere located at 1 mb. ERA-I relies on<br>a 4-D-VAR system which uses observations within the windows of 15:00–03:00 UTC and 03:00–15:00 UTC (in the next<br>day) to initialise forecast simulations starting at 00:00 UTC<br>and 12:00 UTC, respectively. In order to allow sufficient<br>spin-up, the first nine hours of the forecast simulations are<br>not used. All fields used in this study where extracted on the<br>ECMWF reduced Gaussian N128 grid (0.75◦ × 0.75◦<br>). Six<br>PLs are used in this study covering the range of 1000–500 mb<br>(1000, 925, 850, 775, 650, 500), corresponding to approximately an elevation range of 150–5500 m a.s.l. ERA-I fields<br>used are listed in Table 1.<br>2.2 Pressure levels below model surface<br>While ERA-I model levels are computed from the model<br>orography surface to top of the atmosphere, pressure-level<br>data is given in the interval 1000 mb (approximately sealevel)–1 mb (top of atmosphere). This means that pressurelevel data exist below the model-grid surface in regions with<br>rugged topography. The extrapolation of fields below the surface uses different methods to those above the model surface. For example, geopotential is extrapolated below the<br>model surface as a function of surface geopotential, surface temperature, temperature at mean sea level, surface<br>pressure and pressure-level value. Temperature is extrapolated below the model surface to a given pressure level as<br>a quadratic function of surface temperature, surface pressure and pressure-level value. Wind and relative humidity are<br>both constant below model surface and equal to the lowest<br>model level values (ECMWF, 2011). Additionally a greater<br>quantity of data is assimilated from above surface observations. Therefore, it can be expected that there is a difference in quality of above/below grid pressure-level data. In<br>addition, measurement locations below grid level are more<br>likely to be in valleys and therefore there will be greater exposure of observations to subgrid processes, not represented<br>by the data. See ECMWF (2011) for full details of extrapolation methods. However, it is difficult to disentangle this effect<br>from the fact that measurements above the model surface are<br>more likely to represent the free atmosphere and, therefore,<br>be more accurately simulated than those strongly effected by<br>topographic effects (e.g. Mesinger et al., 2006; Jarosch et al.,<br>2012) such as inversion layers or topographically modified<br>wind fields. This issue is addressed in the results section.<br>2.3 Evaluation data sets<br>See Table 1 for an overview (by variable) of the evaluation<br>(OBS) data sets used in this study. The MeteoSwiss automatic meteorological network (ANETZ) covers 40 stations<br>(hourly data) ranging 1132–3580 m a.s.l. and represents both<br>high mountain locations and valleys. The IMIS station network of the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research<br>is biased towards high alpine locations (there are few valley<br>stations) but represents topographical heterogeneity in terms<br>of slope and aspect more comprehensively than ANETZ stations. Network elevation range is 1562–3341 m a.s.l.

To perform the wind modification calculations, the local slope, aspect, and topographic<br>curvature (a measure of relative prominence with respect to<br>surrounding terrain) are required (Appendix C2).<br>3.1.2 Radiative fluxes<br>LW↓sub is computed by deriving a cloud component of allsky emissivity at grid level and using Tsub, Rhsub to describe variability with elevation. First, clear-sky emissivity<br>at SUB (<br>cl<br>sub) and GRID (<br>cl<br>grid) are computed according to<br>Konzelmann et al. (1994):<br><br>cl<br>sub/grid = 0.23 + x1(pVsub/grid/Tsub/grid)<br>1/x2<br>, (1)<br>where x1 = 0.43 and x2 = 5.7 (Gubler et al., 2012) and water vapour pressure, pV is a function of Rh (Appendix C3).<br>The all-sky emissivity is computed at GRID using LW↓grid<br>and the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:<br><br>as<br>grid = LW ↓grid /σ T 4<br>grid, (2)<br>where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant of 5.67 ×<br>10−8<br>Js−1 m−2 K<br>−4<br>. We estimate the cloud-based component of emissivity (1) at GRID though subtraction of <br>cl<br>grid<br>from <br>as<br>grid in order to apply this correction directly at SUB.<br>Finally, LW ↓sub can be computed accounting for elevation<br>changes in T and Rh by<br>LW ↓sub=<br><br><br>cl<br>sub + 1<br>σ T 4<br>sub. (3)<br>This approach assumes that cloud emissivity at GRID and<br>SUB elevations are the same, but accounts for reduction of<br>clear-sky emissivity with elevation. This is important as the<br>steepest gradients in LW↓ are often found in clear-sky conditions due to reduction in atmospheric water vapour with<br>elevation. After elevation correction, terrain effects are accounted for by reduction of LW↓sub by multiplication with<br>the sky-view factor, being the fraction of sky that is visible at<br>SUB (Vd). This assumes that LW↓ is isotropic.<br>SW↓sub is computed in a three-step process: (1) partitioning of SW↓grid into direct and diffuse components, (2) elevation adjustment of direct, and (3) topographic correction of<br>both diffuse and direct at point scale. SW↓grid can be partitioned into direct (SW↓<br>dir<br>grid) and and diffuse (SW↓<br>dif<br>grid) components according to the hourly regression model of RuizArias et al. (2010b) which has been developed based on 21<br>stations in Europe and USA (Appendix ). This method uses<br>the clearness index, which is computed by ratioing SW↓grid<br>against irradiance at top of atmosphere, SW↓toa and in doing<br>so estimates a solar transmissivity of the atmospheric column (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that the regression model<br>was developed on hourly data, whereas we apply it to 3 h<br>averages. The vertical gradient of global irradiance between<br>GRID and SUB is mainly determined by the direct component together with difference in the optical path length 1m,<br>assuming that attenuative properties of the atmosphere are<br>constant between the two elevations. Therefore, we apply an<br>elevation correction to SW↓<br>dir<br>grid only, largely following methods of Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010b) (Fig. 3b). First, 1m is computed as<br>1m = 1z cos θz, (4)<br>where 1z is difference in elevation and θz is the solar zenith<br>angle. We can then solve the Beer–Lambert law for direct<br>irradiance to obtain the broadband attenuation coefficient (k):<br>SW ↓<br>dir= SW ↓<br>toa e<br>−km, (5)<br>where m = 1/cos θz (except for large values of θz). The difference in SW↓<br>dir due to elevation difference between GRID<br>and SUB can then be found as<br>1SW ↓<br>dir<br>SW ↓dir ≈ 1 − e<br>−k1z cos θz<br>. (6)<br>Equation (6) shows direct irradiance should increase exponentially with elevation given constant k and elevation-based<br>change in irradiance is maximum when sun is at zenith and<br>zero when sun is at horizon. As the correction is only applicable to clear-sky conditions, it is applied when the air-masscorrected clearness index kt<br>is greater than 0.65 (Perez et al.,<br>1990).<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain 393<br>3.1.3 Precipitation<br>Precipitation patterns in mountain regions are driven by<br>a range of complex mechanisms which depend upon, for<br>example, season, geographical climate (maritime, continental) and structure of orography (Leung and Ghan, 1995;<br>Lundquist et al., 2010; Smith and Barstad, 2004). Precipitation is therefore strongly variable in both time and space.<br>Figure 4 gives an overview of the combined climatology and<br>lapse rate approach used to address this problem (e.g. Früh<br>et al., 2006). It should be noted that this routine can also be<br>implemented using only the lapse rate, in order to remove<br>any dependency on climatology data. We acknowledge that<br>the quality of the data set is heavily dependent on density of<br>observations and therefore, better than average results should<br>be expected in our study domain.<br>First, the elevation signal of the climatology data is removed by dividing by the non-linear lapse rate (λp) of Liston<br>and Elder (2006) (Appendix C5), and then normalising to<br>the GRID reference elevation. Pgrid is then disaggregated according to the subgrid variability as described by the normalised climatology (now elevation independent). Each of<br>the ith (in this study 1–25) climatology grid-cells Pclim are<br>normalised by the sum of Pclim contained in each ERA<br>course grid box, resulting in a subgrid disaggregation factor<br>Wsub,<br>Wsub = P<br>i<br>clim /<br>XPclim. (11)<br>In this study we use the CRU climatology but other sources<br>of subgrid observations could be used. Globally, or near globally available data sets (gauge and satellite based) include the<br>Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (Huffman et al., 2007),<br>Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (Beck et al., 2005)<br>and Climatic Research Unit (New et al., 2002) or regionally available such as PRISM (Daly et al., 1994) or even<br>direct observations if available. The product of Pgrid and<br>Wsub generates a subgrid distribution of precipitation at the<br>climatology resolution, that is conservative of the coarsegrid forcing Pgrid. Finally, λp is applied to capture fine-scale<br>precipitation-elevation gradients in order to obtain Psub,<br>Psub = Pgrid · Wsub · λp. (12)<br>It should be noted that this method simply applies a scaling<br>to the precipitation field and does not estimate the precipitation phase (snow–rain partition), this is done by the model<br>which the precipitation field is used to drive.<br>3.2 Reference methods<br>The following is a description of the reference parameterisations with which we compare the current scheme. We do not<br>intend this comparison to be exhaustive, but to merely serve<br>as a reference point, based on common parameterisations.<br>Tgrid is simply extrapolated according to a fixed lapse of<br>6.5 ◦C km−1<br>(e.g. Blandford et al., 2008). Rh is not a linear<br>function of elevation and so the relatively linear dew point<br>temperature (Td) is often used (Liston and Elder, 2006). Rh<br>can be converted to Td as a function of T and pV. In this<br>study Tdgrid is available, so this step is unnecessary.<br>Tdsub can be computed using a variable lapse rate (Kunkel,<br>1989):<br>lapse = λ · c/b, (13)<br>where λ is a vapour pressure coefficient that varies during<br>each month of the year (Kunkel, 1989) and constants b =<br>22.452, c = 272.55 ◦C are given by Buck (1981). Finally,<br>Tdsub is then converted back to Rhsub as a function of Tsub.<br>LW↓ is parameterised as a function of T and pV and cloud<br>cover according to the clear-sky formula of Konzelmann<br>et al. (1994) (Eq. 1) and the all-sky formula of Pirazzini et al.<br>(2000) while accounting for Vd,<br>LW ↓= <br>cl(1 − N<br>p1<br>) +<br><br><br>asN<br>p2<br><br>σ T 4<br>, (14)<br>where <br>cl is given by Eq. (1), N is given by the ERA-I total<br>cloud product (0–1), p1 = 6, p2 = 4 and <br>as = 0.979. Wind<br>is adjusted by 40 % per km (i.e increased above grid level<br>reduced below grid level) (Plüss, 1997). SW↓ is not compared to a reference method as the methods (i.e. partitioning,<br>elevation and topographic correction) used in this study are<br>commonly used elsewhere (i.e. Oliphant, 2003; Schroeder<br>et al., 2009). Precipitation is scaled with a non-linear lapse<br>rate (Liston and Elder, 2006).<br>4 Experiments<br>4.1 Location<br>The study region contains the entire Swiss Alps and uses 19<br>ERA-I grid boxes to cover all observations that are used to<br>evaluate the methods. Switzerland contains one of the most<br>densely observed mountain regions in the world and, therefore, is a suitable region within which to evaluate this method<br>and specifically its performance with respect to vertical information, as it covers a large elevation gradient of 195–<br>4634 m a.s.l. (Fig. 1).<br>4.2 Set-up<br>The experimental strategy is as follows: results of the current methods (TopoSCALE) are compared to (1) unscaled<br>grid level ERA-I fields (GRID) and (2) reference methods<br>(REF), where appropriate. TopoSCALE, GRID and REF are<br>all computed on 3 h time step and then aggregated to daily<br>mean values to be assessed against the OBS data sets, for the<br>period 1 January 1996–31 December 2008 (Sect. 2.3). Statistical evaluation is primarily performed using the correlation<br>coefficient (R), the root mean squared error (RMSE) and bias<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

A density plot is used because of the large<br>number of points plotted (e.g. ∼ 106<br>in the case of T ).<br>For T , (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant<br>improvement in R, RMSE and BIAS of T with respect<br>to observations. Applying a fixed lapse rate (REF) improves the RMSE by 0.75 ◦C over grid level values whereas<br>TopoSCALE improves RMSE by 2.66 ◦C. The BIAS in REF<br>(1.5) is similar to GRID (1.62), whereas TopoSCALE significantly improves this (−0.02). Bias in TopoSCALE is concentrated at extremes of temperature (i.e. low temperatures<br>are too high and high temperatures are too low).<br>For Rh (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant improvement in the correlation and modest improvement in<br>RMSE (due to the poorly performing cluster at high humidity). There appears to be a high degree of uncertainty in saturated conditions (i.e. measurements at or close to 100 %) in<br>all cases. TopoSCALE shows significant improvement over<br>GRID and REF (approximately the same performance) particular in the interval 0–60 % which is significant for processes such as sublimation which occur in dry atmospheric<br>conditions. Both GRID and REF seem unable to represent<br>humidities less than 30 %. This could possibly be that dry<br>(often well below 30% humidity) Foehn winds are represented in the pressure-level data but absent from surface data.<br>Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series that are possibly related to changing patterns of data<br>assimilation (Fig. 7a). At least one of these artefacts fits<br>to a major data introduction (European wind profilers in<br>2002). Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted to a three<br>year period (1996–1998) that was stable. Comparison of<br>distributions of wind speed show a large improvement of<br>TopoSCALE over GRID especially in the R value and BIAS.<br>There is still a large degree of scatter especially at high wind<br>speeds. The most significant result is an improvement in<br>BIAS with a shift of the distribution to the 1 : 1 line, while<br>the GRID data is not able to represent values greater than<br>5 ms−1<br>.<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●●<br>●<br>●<br>● ● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●

Specifically, controlled stratospheric aerosol injection appears able to greatly moderate most environmental impacts—especially warming—and consequently most ecological, economic, and other impacts of climate change across most regions. However, because warming from greenhouse gases and cooling from SRM would operate differently across latitudes and seasons, a world where global warming would be offset by SRM would have a different climate from the world where this warming did not occur in the first place, mainly as the result of an altered hydrological cycle. Furthermore, confidence in the current projections of how SRM would affect regional climate and ecosystems is low.[1]<br>SRM would pose environmental risks. In addition to its imperfect reduction of climate-change impacts, stratospheric aerosol injection could, for example, slow the recovery of stratospheric ozone. If a significant SRM intervention were to suddenly stop and not be resumed, the cooling would end relatively rapidly, posing serious environmental risks. Some environmental risks may remain unknown. <br>Governing SRM is challenging for multiple reasons, including that several countries would likely be capable of doing it alone.[2] For now, there is no formal international framework designed to regulate SRM, although aspects of existing international law would be applicable. The most common concern about SRM is that its research and evaluation might undermine reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Issues of governance and effectiveness are intertwined, as poorly governed use of SRM might lead to its highly suboptimal implementation. Thus, many questions regarding the acceptable deployment of SRM, or even its research and development, are currently unanswered.<br><br><br>At the 6th UN Environmental Assembly (UNEA 6) February/Mar 2024 in Nairobi, Switzerland failed for the second time with a proposal to hold a discussion on “Solar Radiation Management” (SRM) measures in an international body begin. There will still be no structured global debate on the possible use of geoengineering techniques. The countries mistrust each other and argue about the scope and aim of an investigation. Meanwhile, other actors are creating facts. The USA, Saudi Arabia and Japan spoke out against a generally accessible knowledge base at the multilateral level.[3]<br><br>Overview[edit]<br>SRM can be deployed on different scales. This graph shows the baseline radiative forcing under three different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, and how it would be affected by the deployment of SAI, starting from 2034, to either halve the speed of warming by 2100, to halt the warming, or to reverse it entirely.[4]<br>Averaged over the year and location, the Earth's atmosphere receives 340 W/m2 of solar irradiance from the sun.[5] Due to elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, the net difference between the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth and the amount of energy radiated back to space has risen from 1.7 W/m2 in 1980, to 3.1 W/m2 in 2019.[6] This imbalance—called radiative forcing—means that the Earth absorbs more energy than it lets off, causing global temperatures to rise.[7]<br>Solar radiation modification (SRM) would increase Earth's ability to deflect sunlight, such as by increasing the albedo of the atmosphere or the surface. The goal of SRM would be to reduce radiative forcing by increasing Earth's albedo (reflectivity). An increase in planetary albedo of 1% would reduce radiative forcing by 2.35 W/m2, eliminating most of global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, while a 2% albedo increase would negate the warming effect of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration[8]<br>SRM methods include:[8]<br><br>Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), in which small particles would be injected into the upper atmosphere to cool the planet with both global dimming and increased albedo<br>Marine cloud brightening (MCB), which would spray fine sea water to whiten clouds and thus increase cloud reflectivity<br>Albedo enhancement, in which cool roofs and reflectors are would increase the albedo or reflectivity of the Earth's surface to deflect solar radiation back into space[9]<br>Cirrus cloud thinning (CCT), which is strictly not SRM but shares many of characteristics as the other methods.[10]<br>A 2023 report from the UN Environment Progamme concluded that "Modelling studies have consistently shown that climate change (in terms of temperature and hydrological metrics) in nearly all regions is much smaller with a carefully designed SRM deployment than in a world with continued climate change and without an SRM deployment."[11]<br>SRM's climatic effects would be rapid and reversible, which would bring the obvious advantage of speed but the serious disadvantage of sudden warming if it were to be stopped suddenly and not resumed.[12]<br><br>Potential roles[edit]<br>Regardless of the method used, there is a wide range of potential deployment scenarios for SRM, which differ both in the scale of warming they would offset and their target endpoint. <br>SRM is generally intended to complement, not replace, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal. For example, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report concurs: "There is high agreement in the literature that for addressing climate change risks SRM cannot be the main policy response to climate change and is, at best, a supplement to achieving sustained net zero or net negative CO2 emission levels globally".[1] However, SRM's actual role may differ from this, such as being used as an emergency response to sudden climate change impacts. <br>Initially, the majority of studies considered relatively extreme scenarios where modeled global emissions were very high and are offset with similarly high levels of SRM. In later years, research explored using SRM to partially offset global warming and aid to avoid failing the Paris Agreement goals of 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and 2 °C (3.6 °F) or to halve warming.[13]<br><br>Potential complementary responses to climate change: greenhouse gas emissions abatement, carbon dioxide removal, SRM, and adaptation. Originally called the "napkin diagram" and drawn by John Shepherd.[14]<br>SRM's speed of effect gives it two potential roles in managing risks from climate change. First, if mitigation (that is, emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal) and adaptation continue to be insufficient, and/or if climate change impacts are severe due to greater-than-expected climate sensitivity, tipping points, or vulnerability, then SRM could reduce these unexpectedly severe impacts. In this way, the knowledge to implement SRM as a backup plan would serve as a sort of risk diversification or insurance. Second, SRM could be implemented along with aggressive mitigation and adaptation in order "buy time" by slowing the rate of climate change and/or to eliminate the worst climate impacts until net negative emissions reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. (See diagram.)<br>SRM has been suggested as a means of stabilizing regional climates. There have also been proposals to focus SRM at the poles, in order to combat sea level rise[15] or regional MCB in order to protect coral reefs from bleaching. However, there is low confidence about the ability to control geographical boundaries of the effect.[1]<br><br>History[edit]<br>In 1965, during the administration of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, President's Science Advisory Committee delivered "Restoring the Quality of Our Environment", a landmark report which warned of the harmful effects of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and mentioned "deliberately bringing about countervailing climatic changes", including "raising the albedo, or reflectivity, of the Earth".[16] As early as 1974, Russian climatologist Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming ever became a serious threat, it could be countered with airplane flights in the stratosphere, burning sulfur to make aerosols that would reflect sunlight away.[17] Along with carbon dioxide removal, SRM was discussed jointly as "geoengineering" in a 1992 climate change report from the US National Academies.[18] The topic was essentially taboo in the climate science and policy communities until Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen published an influential scholarly paper in 2006.[19] Major reports by the Royal Society (2009),[8] the US National Academies (2015, 2021),[20][21] and the UN Environment Programme[11] followed.<br>As of 2018, total research funding worldwide remained modest, at less than 10 million US dollars annually.[22] Almost all research into SRM has to date consisted of computer modeling or laboratory tests,[23] and there are calls for more research funding as the science is poorly understood.[24][25] Major academic institutions, including Harvard University, have begun research into SRM,[26] with NOAA alone investing $22 million from 2019 to 2022, though few outdoor tests have been run to date.[27] The Degrees Initiative is a UK registered charity,[28] established to build capacity in developing countries to evaluate SRM.[29] The 2021 US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report recommended an initial investment into SRM research of $100–$200 million over five years.[25]<br><br>Evidence of effectiveness and impacts[edit]<br>Modeling evidence of the effect of greenhouse gases and SRM on average annual temperature (left column) and precipitation (right column).[30] The first row (a) is moderately high continued greenhouse gas emissions (RCP4.5) at the end of the century. The second row (b) is the same emissions scenario and time, with SRM to reduce global warming to 1.5 °C. The third row (c) is the same emissions scenario but in the near future, when global warming would be 1.5 °C, with no SRM. The similarity between the second and third rows suggests that SRM could reduce climate change reasonably well.<br>Climate models consistently indicate that a moderate magnitude of SRM would bring important aspects of the climate—for example, average and extreme temperature, water availability, cyclone intensity—closer to their preindustrial values at a subregional resolution.[13] (See figure.)<br><br>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in its Sixth Assessment Report:[31]: 69 .... SRM could offset some of the effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate, including the carbon and water cycles. However, there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scales and seasonal time scales, and large uncertainties associated with aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions persist. The cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO2 sinks, but this would not stop CO2 from increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. It is likely that abrupt water cycle changes will occur if SRM techniques are implemented rapidly. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emission reduction and CDR would avoid these termination effects.The 2021 US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report states: "The available research indicates that SG could reduce surface temperatures and potentially ameliorate some risks posed by climate change (e.g., to avoid crossing critical climate 'tipping points'; to reduce harmful impacts of weather extremes)."[21]<br>SRM would imperfectly compensate for anthropogenic climate changes. Greenhouse gases warm throughout the globe and year, whereas SRM reflects light more effectively at low latitudes and in the hemispheric summer (due to the sunlight's angle of incidence) and only during daytime. Deployment regimes could compensate for this heterogeneity by changing and optimizing injection rates by latitude and season.[32][33]<br>In general, greenhouse gases warm the entire planet and are expected to change precipitation patterns heterogeneously, both spatially and temporally, with an overall increase in precipitation. Models indicate that SRM would compensate both of these changes but would do more effectively for temperature than for precipitation. Therefore, using SRM to fully return global mean temperature to a preindustrial level would overcorrect for precipitation changes. This has led to claims that it would dry the planet or even cause drought, but this would depend on the intensity (i.e. radiative forcing) of SRM. Furthermore, soil moisture is more important for plants than average annual precipitation. Because SRM would reduce evaporation, it more precisely compensates for changes to soil moisture than for average annual precipitation.[34] Likewise, the intensity of tropical monsoons is increased by climate change and decreased by SRM.[35] A net reduction in tropical monsoon intensity might manifest at moderate use of SRM, although to some degree the effect of this on humans and ecosystems would be mitigated by greater net precipitation outside of the monsoon system. This has led to claims that SRM "would disrupt the Asian and African summer monsoons", but the impact would depend on the particular implementation regime.<br>People are concerned about climate change largely because of its impacts on people and ecosystems. In the case of the former, agriculture is particularly important. A net increase in agricultural productivity from elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and SRM has also been predicted by some studies due to the combination of more diffuse light and carbon dioxide's fertilization effect.[36] Other studies suggest that SRM would have little net effect on agriculture.[37] Understanding of SRM's effects on ecosystems remains at an early stage. Its reduction of climate change would generally help maintain ecosystems, although the resulting more diffuse incoming sunlight would favor undergrowth relative to canopy growth.<br><br>Advantages[edit]<br>The target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through a combination of emission cuts and carbon dioxide removal, after which global warming stops,[38] but the temperature will only go back down if we remove more carbon dioxide than we emit. SRM on the other hand could cool the planet within months after deployment,[20] thus can act to reduce climate risk while we cut emissions and scale up carbon dioxide removal.  Stratospheric aerosol injection is expected to have low direct financial costs of implementation,[39] relative to the expected costs of both unabated climate change and aggressive mitigation. Finally, the direct climatic effects of SRM are reversible within short timescales.[20]<br><br>Limitations and risks[edit]<br>As well as the imperfect cancellation of the climatic effect of greenhouse gases, described above, there are other significant problems with SRM.<br><br>Incomplete solution to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations[edit]<br>Change in sea surface pH caused by anthropogenic CO2 between the 1700s and the 1990s. This ocean acidification will still be a major problem unless atmospheric CO2 is reduced.<br>SRM does not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and thus does not reduce other effects from these gases, such as ocean acidification.[40] While not an argument against SRM per se, this is an argument against reliance on it to the exclusion of emissions reduction.<br><br>Uncertainty[edit]<br>Most of the information on SRM comes from climate models and volcanic eruptions, which are both imperfect analogues of stratospheric aerosol injection. The climate models used in impact assessments are the same that scientists use to predict the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. Some uncertainties in these climate models (such as aerosol microphysics, stratospheric dynamics, and sub-grid scale mixing) are particularly relevant to SRM and are a target for future research.[41] Volcanoes are an imperfect analogue as they release the material in the stratosphere in a single pulse, as opposed to sustained injection.[42] Modelling is uncertain as little practical research has been done.[2]<br><br>Maintenance and termination shock[edit]<br>Climate models project that SRM interventions would take effect rapidly, but would also quickly fade out if not sustained. This means that their direct effects are effectively reversible, but also risks a rapid rebound after a prolonged interruption, sometimes known as termination shock. SRM effects would be temporary, and thus long-term climate restoration would rely on long-term deployment until sufficient carbon dioxide is removed.[43][44] If SRM masked significant warming, stopped abruptly, and was not resumed within a year or so, the climate would rapidly warm.[45] Global temperatures would rapidly rise towards levels which would have existed without the use of SRM. The rapid rise in temperature might lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude. However, some scholars have argued that this termination shock appears reasonably easy to prevent because it would be in states' interest to resume any terminated deployment regime; and because infrastructure and knowledge could be made redundant and resilient, allowing states to act on this interest and gradually phase out unwanted SRM.[46][47]<br>Some claim that SRM "would basically be impossible to stop."[48][49] This is true only of a long-term deployment strategy. A short-term, temporary strategy would limit implementation to decades.[50]<br><br>Disagreement and control[edit]<br>Although climate models of SRM rely on some optimal or consistent implementation, leaders of countries and other actors may disagree as to whether, how, and to what degree SRM be used. This could result in suboptimal deployments and exacerbate international tensions.[51]<br>Some observers claim that SRM is likely to be militarized or weaponized. However, weaponization is disputed because SRM would be imprecise.[52] Regardless, the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques, which prohibits weaponizing SRM, came into force in 1978.[53]<br><br>Unwanted or premature use[edit]<br>There is a risk that countries may start using SRM without proper precaution or research. SRM, at least by stratospheric aerosol injection, appears to have low direct implementation costs relative to its potential impact. This creates a different problem structure.[54][55] Whereas the provision of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal present collective action problems (because ensuring a lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a public good), a single country or a handful of countries could implement SRM. Many countries have the financial and technical resources to undertake SRM.[2]<br>In 2000s, some have suggested that SRM could be within reach of a lone "Greenfinger", a wealthy individual who takes it upon him or herself to be the "self-appointed protector of the planet".[56][57] Others disagree and argue that states will insist on maintaining control of SRM.[58] Subsequent research had dimmed this notion, as the annual costs of around $18 billion per 1 °C (1.8 °F) of cooling are likely to be prohibitive for even the wealthiest individuals.[4]<br><br>Distribution of effects[edit]<br>Both climate change and SRM would affect various groups of people differently. Some observers describe SRM as necessarily creating "winners and losers". However, models indicate that SRM at a moderate intensity would return important climatic values of almost all regions of the planet closer to preindustrial conditions.[citation needed] That is, if all people prefer preindustrial conditions, such a moderate use could be a Pareto improvement.<br>Developing countries are particularly important, as they are more vulnerable to climate change. All else equal, they therefore have the most to gain from a judicious use of SRM. Observers sometimes claim that SRM poses greater risks to developing countries. There is no evidence that the unwanted environmental impacts of SRM would be significantly greater in developing countries, although potential disruptions to tropical monsoons are a concern. But in one sense, this claim of greater risk is true for the same reason that they are more vulnerable to greenhouse gas-induced climate change: developing countries have weaker infrastructure and institutions, and their economies rely to a greater degree on agriculture. They are thus more vulnerable to all climate changes, whether from greenhouse gases or SRM.<br><br>Lessened mitigation[edit]<br>The existence of SRM may reduce the political and social impetus for mitigation.[59] This has generally been called a potential "moral hazard", although risk compensation may be a more accurate term. This concern causes many environmental groups and campaigners to be reluctant to advocate or discuss SRM.[60] However, several public opinion surveys and focus groups have found evidence of either assertion of a desire to increase emission cuts in the face of SRM, or of no effect.[8][61][62][63][64][65][66] Likewise, some modelling work suggests that the threat of SRM may in fact increase the likelihood of emissions reduction.[67][68][69][70]<br><br>Effect on sky and clouds[edit]<br>Managing solar radiation using aerosols or cloud cover would involve changing the ratio between direct and indirect solar radiation. This would affect plant life[71] and solar energy.[72] Visible light, useful for photosynthesis, is reduced proportionally more than is the infrared portion of the solar spectrum due to the mechanism of Mie scattering.[73]  As a result, deployment of atmospheric SRM would reduce by at least 2–5% the growth rates of phytoplankton, trees, and crops [74] between now and the end of the century.[75] Uniformly reduced net shortwave radiation would hurt solar photovoltaics by the same 2–5% because of the bandgap of silicon photovoltaics.[76]<br><br>Proposed forms[edit]<br>Atmospheric[edit]<br>Stratospheric aerosol injection[edit]<br>Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering<br>Main article: Stratospheric aerosol injection<br>Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere is the proposed SRM method that has received the most sustained attention. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that Stratospheric aerosol injection "is the most-researched SRM method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5 °C."[77] This technique would mimic a cooling phenomenon that occurs naturally by the eruption of volcanoes.[78] Sulfates are the most commonly proposed aerosol, since there is a natural analogue with (and evidence from) volcanic eruptions. Alternative materials such as using photophoretic particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond have been proposed.[79][80][81][82][83] Delivery by custom aircraft appears most feasible, with artillery and balloons sometimes discussed.[84][85][86] The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at $5 to 10 billion US dollars.[87] This technique could give much more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is sufficient to entirely offset the warming caused by a doubling of carbon dioxide.<br><br>Marine cloud brightening[edit]<br>Main article: Marine cloud brightening<br>Various cloud reflectivity methods have been suggested, such as that proposed by John Latham and Stephen Salter, which works by spraying seawater in the atmosphere to increase the reflectivity of clouds.[89] The extra condensation nuclei created by the spray would change the size distribution of the drops in existing clouds to make them whiter.[90] The sprayers would use fleets of unmanned rotor ships known as Flettner vessels to spray mist created from seawater into the air to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from the Earth.[91] The whitening effect is created by using very small cloud condensation nuclei, which whiten the clouds due to the Twomey effect.<br>This technique can give more than 3.7 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is sufficient to reverse the warming effect of a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration.<br><br>Cirrus cloud thinning[edit]<br>Main article: Cirrus cloud thinning<br>Natural cirrus clouds are believed to have a net warming effect. These could be dispersed by the injection of various materials. This method is strictly not SRM, as it increases outgoing longwave radiation instead of decreasing incoming shortwave radiation. However, because it shares some of the physical and especially governance characteristics as the other SRM methods, it is often included.[92]<br><br>Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement[edit]<br>Main article: Ocean fertilization<br>Enhancing the natural marine sulfur cycle by fertilizing a small portion with iron—typically considered to be a greenhouse gas remediation method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight.[93][94] Such fertilization, especially in the Southern Ocean, would enhance dimethyl sulfide production and consequently cloud reflectivity. This could potentially be used as regional SRM, to slow Antarctic ice from melting.[citation needed] Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.<br><br>Terrestrial[edit]<br>Cool roof[edit]<br>The albedo of several types of roofs (lower = hotter)<br>Main article: Reflective surfaces (climate engineering)<br>Painting roof materials in white or pale colors to reflect solar radiation, known as 'cool roof' technology, is encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California).[95] This technique is limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the constrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01 and 0.19 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated.[88] This is small relative to the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Moreover, while in small cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials, it can be costly if implemented on a larger scale. A 2009 Royal Society report states that, "the overall cost of a 'white roof method' covering an area of 1% of the land surface (about 1012 m2) would be about $300 billion/yr, making this one of the least effective and most expensive methods considered."[8] However, it can reduce the need for air conditioning, which emits carbon dioxide and contributes to global warming.<br><br>Radiative cooling[edit]<br>Some papers have proposed the deployment of specific thermal emitters (whether via advanced paint, or printed rolls of material) which would simultaneously reflect sunlight and also emit energy at longwave infrared (LWIR) lengths of 8–20 μm, which is too short to be trapped by the greenhouse effect and would radiate into outer space. It has been suggested that to stabilize Earth's energy budget and thus cease warming, 1–2% of the Earth's surface (area equivalent to over half of Sahara) would need to be covered with these emitters, at the deployment cost of $1.25 to $2.5 trillion. While low next to the estimated $20 trillion saved by limiting the warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) rather than 2 °C (3.6 °F), it does not include any maintenance costs.[96][97]<br><br>Ocean and ice changes[edit]<br>Oceanic foams have also been suggested, using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the photic zone. A less costly proposal is to simply lengthen and brighten existing ship wakes.[98]<br>Arctic sea ice formation could be increased by pumping deep cooler water to the surface.[99] Sea ice (and terrestrial) ice can be thickened by increasing albedo with silica spheres.[100] Glaciers flowing into the sea may be stabilized by blocking the flow of warm water to the glacier.[101] Salt water could be pumped out of the ocean and snowed onto the West Antarctic ice sheet.[102][103]<br><br>Vegetation[edit]<br>Reforestation in tropical areas has a cooling effect. Changes to grassland have been proposed to increase albedo.[104] This technique can give 0.64 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of carbon dioxide, but could make a minor contribution. Selecting or genetically modifying commercial crops with high albedo has been suggested.[105] This has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement, with farmers simply switching from one variety to another. Temperate areas may experience a 1 °C cooling as a result of this technique.[106] This technique is an example of bio-geoengineering. This technique can give 0.44 W/m2 of globally averaged negative forcing,[88] which is insufficient to offset the 3.7 W/m2 of positive forcing from a doubling of carbon dioxide, but could make a minor contribution.<br><br>Space-based[edit]<br>The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. The image is simplified, as a 1000 kilometre diameter lens is considered sufficient by most proposals, and would be much smaller than shown. Additionally, a zone plate would only be a few nanometers thick.<br>Main articles: Space sunshade and Space mirror (climate engineering)<br>There has been a range of proposals to reflect or deflect solar radiation from space, before it even reaches the atmosphere, commonly described as a space sunshade.[80] The most straightforward is to have mirrors orbiting around the Earth—an idea first suggested even before the wider awareness of climate change, with rocketry pioneer Hermann Oberth considering it a way to facilitate terraforming projects in 1923.[107] and this was followed by other books in 1929, 1957 and 1978.[108][109][110] By 1992, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences described a plan to suspend 55,000 mirrors with an individual area of 100 square meters in a Low Earth orbit.[8] Another contemporary plan was to use space dust to replicate Rings of Saturn around the equator, although a large number of satellites would have been necessary to prevent it from dissipating. A 2006 variation on this idea suggested relying entirely on a ring of satellites electromagnetically tethered in the same location. In all cases, sunlight exerts pressure which can displace these reflectors from orbit over time, unless stabilized by enough mass. Yet, higher mass immediately drives up launch costs.[8]<br>In an attempt to deal with this problem, other researchers have proposed Inner lagrangian point between the Earth and the Sun as an alternative to near-Earth orbits, even though this tends to increase manufacturing or delivery costs instead. In 1989, a paper suggested founding a lunar colony, which would produce and deploy diffraction grating made out of a hundred million tonnes of glass.[111] In 1997, a single, very large mesh of aluminium wires "about one millionth of a millimetre thick" was also proposed.[112][self-published source?] Two other proposals from the early 2000s advocated the use of thin metallic disks 50–60 cm in diameter, which would either be launched from the Earth at a rate of once per minute over several decades, or be manufactured from asteroids directly in orbit.[8] When summarizing these options in 2009, the Royal Society concluded that their deployment times are measured in decades and costs in the trillions of USD, meaning that they are "not realistic potential contributors to short-term, temporary measures for avoiding dangerous climate change", and may only be competitive with the other geoengineering approaches when viewed from a genuinely long (a century or more) perspective, as the long lifetime of L1-based approaches could make them cheaper than the need to continually renew atmospheric-based measures over that timeframe.[8]<br>Relatively few researchers have revisited the subject since that Royal Society review, as it became accepted that space-based approaches would cost about 1000 times more than their terrestrial alternatives.[113] In 2022, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report had discussed SAI, MCB, CCT and even attempts to alter albedo on the ground or in the ocean, yet completely ignored space-based approaches.[1] There are still some proponents, who argue that unlike stratospheric aerosol injection, space-based approaches are advantageous because they do not interfere directly with the biosphere and ecosystems.[114] After the IPCC report was published, three astronomers have revisited the space dust concept, instead advocating for a lunar colony which would continuously mine the Moon in order to eject lunar dust into space on a trajectory where it would interfere with sunlight streaming towards the Earth. Ejections would have to be near-continuous, as since the dust would scatter in a matter of days, and about 10 million tons would have to be dug out and launched annually.[115] The authors admit that they lack a background in either climate or rocket science, and the proposal may not be logistically feasible.[116]<br>In 2021, researchers in Sweden considered building solar sails in the near-Earth orbit, which would then arrive to L1 point over 600 days one by one. Once they all form an array in situ, the combined 1.5 billion sails would have total area of 3.75 million square kilometers, while their combined mass is estimated in a range between 83 million tons (present-day technology) and 34 million tons (optimal advancements). This proposal would cost between five and ten trillion dollars, but only once launch cost has been reduced to US$50/kg, which represents a massive reduction from the present-day costs of $4400-$2700/kg[117] for the most widely used launch vehicles.[118] In July 2022, a pair of researchers from MIT Senseable City Lab, Olivia Borgue and Andreas M. Hein, have instead proposed integrating nanotubes made out of silicon dioxide into ultra-thin polymeric films (described as "space bubbles" in the media [114]), whose semi-transparent nature would allow them to resist the pressure of solar wind at L1 point better than any alternative with the same weight. The use of these "bubbles" would limit the mass of a distributed sunshade roughly the size of Brazil to about 100,000 tons, much lower than the earlier proposals. However, it would still require between 399 and 899 yearly launches of a vehicle such as SpaceX Starship for a period of around 10 years, even though the production of the bubbles themselves would have to be done in space. The flights would not begin until research into production and maintenance of these bubbles is completed, which the authors estimate would require a minimum of 10–15 years. After that, the space shield may be large enough by 2050 to prevent crossing of the 2 °C (3.6 °F) threshold.[113][114][119]<br><br>Governance[edit]<br>The governance of SRM contains many relevant aspects. The potential use of SRM poses several challenges because of its high leverage, low apparent direct costs, and technical feasibility as well as issues of power and jurisdiction.[120]  Because international law is generally consensual, this creates a challenge of widespread participation being required. Key issues include who will have control over the deployment of SRM and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. A governance framework for SRM must be sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over a long period of time and yet be flexible as information is acquired, the techniques evolve, and interests change through time.<br>Some researchers have suggested that building a global agreement on SRM deployment will be very difficult, and instead power blocs are likely to emerge.[121] There are, however, significant incentives for states to cooperate in choosing a specific SRM policy, which make unilateral deployment a rather unlikely event.[122]<br>Other relevant aspects of the governance of SRM include supporting research, ensuring that it is conducted responsibly, regulating the roles of the private sector and (if any) the military, public engagement, setting and coordinating research priorities, undertaking trusted scientific assessment, building trust, and compensating for possible harms. <br>In 2021, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released their consensus study report Recommendations for Solar Geoengineering Research and Research Governance, concluding:[21]<br><br>[A] strategic investment in research is needed to enhance policymakers' understanding of climate response options. The United States should develop a transdisciplinary research program, in collaboration with other nations, to advance understanding of solar geoengineering's technical feasibility and effectiveness, possible impacts on society and the environment, and social dimensions such as public perceptions, political and economic dynamics, and ethical and equity considerations. The program should operate under robust research governance that includes such elements as a research code of conduct, a public registry for research, permitting systems for outdoor experiments, guidance on intellectual property, and inclusive public and stakeholder engagement processes.<br>Politics[edit]<br>There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, SRM has become a very political issue.<br>There is no meaningful advocacy for the use of SRM. (However, a small start-up business, Make Sunsets, sells "cooling credits" to launch balloons with helium and sulfur dioxide.[123] Many advocates of SRM research have condemned this undertaking.) The most salient political issues thus regard research. <br>As noted above, the governance of SRM will necessarily be international. Few countries have an explicit governmental position on SRM. Most of those that do, such as the United Kingdom[124] and Germany,[125] support SRM research. Other countries, such as the U.S., Germany, China, Finland, Norway, and Japan, as well as the European Union, have funded SRM research.[126] In contrast, Mexico announced that it will prohibit "experimental practices with solar geoengineering",[127] although it remains unclear what this policy will include and whether the policy has actually been implemented. Other countries have expressed a range of views at intergovernmental forums such as the UN Environment Assembly.<br>Support for SRM research comes almost entirely from those who are concerned about climate change. The leading argument is that the risks of likely anthropogenic climate change are great and imminent enough to warrant research and evaluation of a wide range of responses, even one with limitations and risks of its own. Leading this effort have been some climate scientists (such as James Hansen), some of whom ave endorsed one or both public letters that support further SRM research.[128][129] Scientific organizations that have called for further research include the World Climate Research Programme,[130] the Royal Society,[8] the US National Academies,[20][21] the American Geophysical Union,[131] the American Meteorological Society, the U.S. Global Change Research Program,[132] the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (UK),[133] Australia's Office of the Chief Scientist,[134] and the Netherlands' scientific assessment institute.[135] Reports from the UN Environment Programme,[11] the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,[136] and the Council on Foreign Relations[137] have likewise called for further SRM research, as have a handful of relatively moderate American environmental nongovernmental organizations (Environmental Defense Fund, Union of Concerned Scientists, and the Natural Resources Defense Council).  <br>A few nongovernmental organizations actively support SRM research and governance dialogues. The Degrees Initiative works toward "changing the global environment in which SRM is evaluated, ensuring informed and confident representation from developing countries."[138] Among other activities, it provides grants to scientists in the Global South. SilverLining is an American organization that advances SRM research as part of "climate interventions to reduce near-term climate risks and impacts."[139] The Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering advances "just and inclusive deliberation" regarding SRM.[140] The Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative catalyzed governance of SRM and carbon dioxide removal,[141] although it ended operations in 2023.<br>Some critics claim that political conservatives, opponents of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and fossil fuel firms are major advocates of SRM research.[142][143] However, only a handful of conservatives and opponents of climate action have expressed support, and there is no evidence that fossil fuel firms are involved in SRM research.[144] In fact, most conservative commentary on SRM has dismissed it as a radical but unnecessary response to the minor problem of climate change.[145] Instead, claims of fossil-fuel industry support typically conflate SRM and carbon dioxide removal—where fossil fuel firms are involved—under the broader term "geoengineering".<br>Opposition to SRM research has largely come from opponents of emerging technologies, green environmental groups, and some academics, mostly from the social science and humanities but counting a few climate scientists. Each of these constituencies includes substantial socialist shares, which call also for a global redistribution of power and wealth. Their leading arguments are that SRM research would lessen cuts to greenhouse gas emissions (and consequently prevent desired socio-economic transformations), that SRM would be impossible to govern, that it would be too risky, and that it would necessarily be unjust. The radical anti-technology organization the ETC Group has been the pioneer in opposing SRM research,[146] and was later joined by the Heinrich Böll Foundation[147] (affiliated with the German Green Party) and the Center for International Environmental Law.[148] In 2022, a dozen academics launched a political campaign for national policies of "no public funding, no outdoor experiments, no patents, no deployment, and no support in international institutions... including in assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."[149] The proponents call this a "non-use agreement", but others have asserted that these five policies, if enacted, would end all meaningful SRM research. The campaign has been endorsed by a few hundred fellow academics and environmental groups.[150] Among the latter is the Climate Action Network, a coalition of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations. (The position from Climate Action Network included a footnote that excluded the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council.[151])<br>In 2021, researchers at Harvard put plans for a SRM test on hold after Indigenous Sámi people objected to the test taking place in their homeland.[152][153] Although the test would not have involved any atmospheric experiments, members of the Saami Council spoke out against the lack of consultation and SRM more broadly. Speaking at a panel organized by the Center for International Environmental Law and other groups, Saami Council Vice President Åsa Larsson Blind said, "This goes against our worldview that we as humans should live and adapt to nature."<br>The Climate Overshoot Commission is an group of global, eminent, and independent figures. It investigated and developed a comprehensive strategy to reduce climate risks which includes SRM in its policy portfolio.[154] The Commission's recommendation regarding SRM are:<br><br>"a moratorium on the deployment of solar radiation modification (SRM) and large-scale outdoor experiments...<br>governance of SRM research should be expanded...<br>SRM research should also be strengthened...<br>an international, independent scientific review and assessment of the best available evidence from SRM research should take place every few years...<br>broad consultations and dialogues on these issues are needed."[155]<br>Public attitudes[edit]<br>There have been a handful of studies into attitudes to and opinions of SRM. These generally find low levels of awareness, uneasiness with the implementation of SRM, cautious support of research, and a preference for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.[156][157] As is often the case with public opinions regarding emerging issues, the responses are highly sensitive to the questions' particular wording and context. Although most public opinion studies have polled residents of developed countries, those that have examined residents of developing countries—which tend to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts—find slightly greater levels of support there.[158][159][160] In fact, the largest assessment of public opinion and perception of SRM, which had over 30,000 respondents in 30 countries, found that "that Global South publics are significantly more favorable about potential benefits and express greater support for climate-intervention technologies."[161]<br><br>See also[edit]<br><br>Global warming portalEcology portalEnvironment portal<br>Climate engineering<br>Cloud seeding<br>Passive daytime radiative cooling<br>Weather Modification Operations and Research Board<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ a b c d Trisos, Christopher H.; Geden, Oliver; Seneviratne, Sonia I.; Sugiyama, Masahiro; van Aalst, Maarten; Bala, Govindasamy; Mach, Katharine J.; Ginzburg, Veronika; de Coninck, Heleen; Patt, Anthony.

The 2-pronged error signature<br>(i.e. both topographic wind speed reduction and enhancement) is corrected by the sub-model. The wind sub-model is<br>difficult to test widely (all other wind results do not include<br>the sub-model) as topographic location data is often not precise enough for point validation, especially where locations<br>are peaks or ridges (i.e. flat ridge can be extracted as a 45◦<br>north face even on a 25 m DEM, e.g. Fisher et al., 2004).<br>This station was chosen for its position on a large slope well<br>represented at the DEM resolution.<br>For LW↓ (9 stations) there are clear improvements over<br>GRID with REF and TopoSCALE due to high dependence<br>on T . To isolate this affect, we performed an additional test<br>where the Pirazzini model used in REF was driven with<br>TopoSCALE T and Rh to assess how well the emissivity<br>based part of the TopoSCALE approach performed over the<br>parameterisations employed in REF. This gave results of<br>R = 0.88 and RMSE = 27.9, suggesting that the larger part<br>of the improvement given by the TopoSCALE approach was<br>due to the improved description of emissivity at grid-level.<br>Overall, TopoSCALE gives an improved result over REF<br>both when REF is driven by lapse derived T and Rh and<br>TopoSCALE derived T and Rh.

Best RMSE performance is seen in clear-sky conditions due to removal of a large proportion of cloud-based<br>uncertainty. However, BIAS is higher in clear-sky conditions due to residual elevation effects affecting the larger<br>direct beam component. TopoSCALE reduces this BIAS by<br>around 3.5 Wm−2<br>as well as improving the RMSE score by<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci. Model Dev., 7, 387–405, 2014<br>396 J. Fiddes and S.

Two problems encountered in the analysis. (a) Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series i.e period 1999–<br>2001 and 2005–2009. Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted<br>to a three year period (1996–1998) that was stable. (b) A common<br>problem with climate models is a low number of dry days which is<br>compensated for by too high frequency and low intensity precipitation. The percentage dry days of OBS is much higher and distribution not even overlapping that of GRID data (IMIS-Data© 2013,<br>SLF).<br>5 Wm−2<br>. BIAS is also reduced under all-sky conditions by<br>TopoSCALE but more modestly and RMSE score is roughly<br>equal. This indicates that TopoSCALE improves the direct<br>beam component most as corrections focus on this part of<br>the radiation budget. In a separate analysis the Erbs partitioning scheme for direct and diffuse SW↓ was tested.<br>As expected the partitioning scheme adds some uncertainty<br>(i.e. R reduced from 0.88 to 0.81/0.75under all-sky conditions). Results for direct/diffuse are negatively/positively<br>biased (−20.4/17.2 %). Full details are not given here as<br>this topic is well covered in the literature (e.g. Erbs et al.,<br>1982; Ruiz-Arias et al., 2010a). Despite high uncertainty introduced in decomposition models, the reaggregation of solar<br>components after elevation/terrain correction minimizes the<br>potential effects in the final terrain corrected estimates (RuizArias et al., 2010a).<br>Two quantities are important in modelling precipitation,<br>quantity and frequency, the former representing total inputs<br>and the second controlling distribution of those inputs over<br>a given period of time. Figure 7 shows a common problem<br>with climate model precipitation fields – that is “constant<br>drizzle” (i.e. a low number of dry days which is compensated for by high frequency and low intensity precipitation)<br>(Piani et al., 2009; Manders et al., 2012). The percentage dry<br>days of OBS is much higher (and not even overlapping) that<br>of ERA-I GRID data. This cannot be changed by the current scheme as precipitation can not be created (to be conservative), but only distributed to the subgrid according to the<br>scheme. A conservative approach would require a temporal<br>redistribution of precipitation as opposed to the spatial corrections we apply in this study. Figure 8 shows that both REF<br>and TopoSCALE improve the distribution of monthly precipitation totals, especially high intensity events accounting for<br>approximately 50 % of mass inputs (central grey line in the<br>0 200 400 600 800<br>0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008<br>Monthly Precipitation [mm/month]<br>Density<br>VAL<br>GRID<br>REF<br>TOPOSCALE<br>OBS<br>Fig. 8.

The dominant effect is from the lapse rate as both<br>REF and TopoSCALE distributions are reasonably similar.<br>Figure 9b gives monthly and annual totals for all eligible stations in the OBS data set. The improvement of TopoSCALE<br>with the inclusion of the spatial component over REF (purely<br>lapse-rate based), is evident with improved R, RMSE and<br>BIAS scores. Figure 9 also highlights the improved simulation of both extremes.<br>5.3 Diurnal cycles<br>The diurnal cycle in surface and boundary-layer variables is<br>important for the global climate system (Dai and Trenberth,<br>2004), and particularly in simulating daily variation in the<br>surface energy balance. Figure 10 shows the diurnal cycle<br>of SW↓ and T , two fields characterised by distinctive diurnal cycles, in order to investigate the performance of the<br>scheme at sub-daily timescales. Additionally these fields represent surface (SW↓) and pressure-level (T ) fields. We calculated the average of all 03:00–00:00 UTC 3 h time steps<br>over the entire study period for months of December and<br>June. A subset of OBS stations is presented, representing<br>an elevation range of 370–3580 m a.s.l. In general, the diurnal cycle of SW↓ appears to be well reproduced by ERA-I.<br>However, seasonal differences are apparent with more accurate simulation in June than December as indicated by the<br>full range of values at 12:00 UTC being more comprehensively represented. Lower amplitudes of diurnal cycles in T<br>make the analysis less clear. In December, diurnal cycles are<br>quite strongly smoothed at low elevation whereas cycles are<br>Geosci.

The median<br>and the majority of the 25–75 % quantile lie within a 1◦<br>error<br>margin. The boxplot for Rh shows that TopoSCALE greatly<br>reduces the seasonal error signal over both REF and GRID.<br>There is an almost constant small negative bias throughout<br>the year. If a bias correction were applied the 25–75 % quantiles would lie within a 10 % (referring to the unit of Rh) error<br>margin. Results for Ws shows the strong bias correction by<br>TopoSCALE throughout the year with slightly poorer performance in spring. Results for LW↓ show a negligible seasonal pattern in GRID, REF and TopoSCALE. TopoSCALE<br>has a lower magnitude of error. Both REF and TopoSCALE<br>show slightly larger errors in April and May (but with opposing sign). Results for SW↓ show negative bias for both<br>all-sky and clear-sky conditions. This effect is strongest in<br>spring/summer, possibly due to higher magnitudes of values.<br>The TopoSCALE correction is most evident under clear-sky<br>conditions in autumn/winter.<br>5.5 Elevation effects<br>Figure 12 shows the daily mean error of GRID, REF and<br>TopoSCALE results (MOD) with respect to OBS as a function of relative elevation of station (e.g. station elevation –<br>grid elevation). Each box may contain multiple stations as<br>long as they share the same elevation difference from their<br>respective ERA-I grid cell. The plot is binned into 400 m intervals (300 m for radiation). This analysis was performed to<br>investigate any elevation dependency of the error signal as<br>well as to look at the effect of the different methods implemented in the ERA-I model to compute variables on pressure<br>levels above and below the model surface (cf. Sect. 2.2). The<br>red box represents surface data (grid-level ±200 m) in order<br>to investigate the relative performance gain/loss close to the<br>grid-surface. This may point to suitability of TopoSCALE<br>outside of mountain areas.<br>The results for T show larger error for stations below grid<br>(RMSE = 2.46) than above (RMSE = 1.60). This result is<br>also slightly negatively biased. This shows that the extrapolation of data below grid level produces a poorer result<br>and only slightly better than REF. The fact that observations tend to be colder indicates that non-represented subgrid effects, such as inversions, could be significant in driving this bias. Above grid level there are large improvements<br>over REF and GRID. REF shows the expected result that<br>error related to lapse-rate-based approaches increases with<br>the distance over which they are applied. The Rh plot shows<br>that TopoSCALE is increasing positively/negatively biased<br>with distance above/below grid level as compared to REF.<br>However the absolute magnitude of error is much lower. Ws<br>bias in GRID error signature is corrected by TopoSCALE (albeit slightly overcompensated above grid). TopoSCALE performs better below grid level, possibly due to lower absolute<br>Ws magnitudes leading to lower error values.<br>Looking only at surface data (red-box), pressure-levelbased results (i.e. TopoSCALE) outperform surface databased results (i.e. GRID and REF) in all cases but most significantly in T and Ws. This is quite surprising as it would<br>seem likely that the surface data should contain more of the<br>boundary layer effect (cf. Sect. 6.3). However, this indicates<br>that TopoSCALE could also be usefully applied in locations<br>close to grid level without reduced quality over surface-based<br>data.<br>6 Discussion<br>Reanalyses are complex products in that they combine a climate model with observations. This section provides a discussion of key issues relevant to the use of reanalysis and<br>other climate data sets, in order to place this study and results<br>in context, as well as to highlight some important limitations<br>to this approach.<br>6.1 Assimilation issues<br>Reanalyses assimilate a large number of observations in spatially and temporally varying quantities and densities. It is<br>therefore important to know which observational data sets<br>are assimilated into the ERA-I product, as this not only affects how independent observations are in terms of validation, but will also suggest how the performance of ERA-I<br>(and therefore TopoSCALE) can vary with observation density. Assimilated data that is also used for evaluation in this<br>study originates from the SYNOP registered MeteoSchweiz<br>stations (a subset of the ANETZ network), and only affects<br>observations of air temperature and relative humidity (Table 1). Furthermore, for screen-level analysis (2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity) surface observations that differ<br>by more that 300 m from the model orography are rejected in<br>the ERA-I assimilation.<br>6.2 Bias and spatial-temporal variability of errors<br>LSM results are sensitive to bias in climate data (e.g. Berg,<br>2003), which may result in unrealistic estimates of mass,<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

You're right that the incoming photons criss-cross each other, but the point is that they only do it a bit. (If they didn't criss-cross each other, you wouldn't be able to form an image of the sun using a pin-hole camera.) The photons' paths differ from each other by at most the Sun's apparent diameter in the sky, which is about half a degree, so they're pretty close to parallel, which is why you can see sunbeams as distinct lines.<br>$\endgroup$<br><br>– N.

(b) A common<br>problem with climate models is a low number of dry days which is<br>compensated for by too high frequency and low intensity precipitation.

BIAS is also reduced under all-sky conditions by<br>TopoSCALE but more modestly and RMSE score is roughly<br>equal. This indicates that TopoSCALE improves the direct<br>beam component most as corrections focus on this part of<br>the radiation budget. In a separate analysis the Erbs partitioning scheme for direct and diffuse SW↓ was tested.<br>As expected the partitioning scheme adds some uncertainty<br>(i.e. R reduced from 0.88 to 0.81/0.75under all-sky conditions). Results for direct/diffuse are negatively/positively<br>biased (−20.4/17.2 %). Full details are not given here as<br>this topic is well covered in the literature (e.g. Erbs et al.,<br>1982; Ruiz-Arias et al., 2010a). Despite high uncertainty introduced in decomposition models, the reaggregation of solar<br>components after elevation/terrain correction minimizes the<br>potential effects in the final terrain corrected estimates (RuizArias et al., 2010a).<br>Two quantities are important in modelling precipitation,<br>quantity and frequency, the former representing total inputs<br>and the second controlling distribution of those inputs over<br>a given period of time. Figure 7 shows a common problem<br>with climate model precipitation fields – that is “constant<br>drizzle” (i.e. a low number of dry days which is compensated for by high frequency and low intensity precipitation)<br>(Piani et al., 2009; Manders et al., 2012). The percentage dry<br>days of OBS is much higher (and not even overlapping) that<br>of ERA-I GRID data. This cannot be changed by the current scheme as precipitation can not be created (to be conservative), but only distributed to the subgrid according to the<br>scheme. A conservative approach would require a temporal<br>redistribution of precipitation as opposed to the spatial corrections we apply in this study.

Figure 9 also highlights the improved simulation of both extremes.<br>5.3 Diurnal cycles<br>The diurnal cycle in surface and boundary-layer variables is<br>important for the global climate system (Dai and Trenberth,<br>2004), and particularly in simulating daily variation in the<br>surface energy balance. Figure 10 shows the diurnal cycle<br>of SW↓ and T , two fields characterised by distinctive diurnal cycles, in order to investigate the performance of the<br>scheme at sub-daily timescales. Additionally these fields represent surface (SW↓) and pressure-level (T ) fields.

A subset of OBS stations is presented, representing<br>an elevation range of 370–3580 m a.s.l.

Sect. 6.3).<br>5.4 Seasonal error<br>Figure 11 gives boxplots of deviation of daily values of MOD<br>from OBS, as defined above and grouped according to month<br>of the year in order to investigate seasonal patterns in the error signature. No averaging is performed, all daily mean values are considered. Results for T suggests that TopoSCALE<br>is too warm in winter and too cold in summer. The median<br>and the majority of the 25–75 % quantile lie within a 1◦<br>error<br>margin. The boxplot for Rh shows that TopoSCALE greatly<br>reduces the seasonal error signal over both REF and GRID.<br>There is an almost constant small negative bias throughout<br>the year. If a bias correction were applied the 25–75 % quantiles would lie within a 10 % (referring to the unit of Rh) error<br>margin. Results for Ws shows the strong bias correction by<br>TopoSCALE throughout the year with slightly poorer performance in spring. Results for LW↓ show a negligible seasonal pattern in GRID, REF and TopoSCALE. TopoSCALE<br>has a lower magnitude of error. Both REF and TopoSCALE<br>show slightly larger errors in April and May (but with opposing sign). Results for SW↓ show negative bias for both<br>all-sky and clear-sky conditions. This effect is strongest in<br>spring/summer, possibly due to higher magnitudes of values.<br>The TopoSCALE correction is most evident under clear-sky<br>conditions in autumn/winter.<br>5.5 Elevation effects<br>Figure 12 shows the daily mean error of GRID, REF and<br>TopoSCALE results (MOD) with respect to OBS as a function of relative elevation of station (e.g. station elevation –<br>grid elevation). Each box may contain multiple stations as<br>long as they share the same elevation difference from their<br>respective ERA-I grid cell. The plot is binned into 400 m intervals (300 m for radiation). This analysis was performed to<br>investigate any elevation dependency of the error signal as<br>well as to look at the effect of the different methods implemented in the ERA-I model to compute variables on pressure<br>levels above and below the model surface (cf. Sect. 2.2). The<br>red box represents surface data (grid-level ±200 m) in order<br>to investigate the relative performance gain/loss close to the<br>grid-surface. This may point to suitability of TopoSCALE<br>outside of mountain areas.<br>The results for T show larger error for stations below grid<br>(RMSE = 2.46) than above (RMSE = 1.60). This result is<br>also slightly negatively biased. This shows that the extrapolation of data below grid level produces a poorer result<br>and only slightly better than REF. The fact that observations tend to be colder indicates that non-represented subgrid effects, such as inversions, could be significant in driving this bias. Above grid level there are large improvements<br>over REF and GRID. REF shows the expected result that<br>error related to lapse-rate-based approaches increases with<br>the distance over which they are applied. The Rh plot shows<br>that TopoSCALE is increasing positively/negatively biased<br>with distance above/below grid level as compared to REF.<br>However the absolute magnitude of error is much lower. Ws<br>bias in GRID error signature is corrected by TopoSCALE (albeit slightly overcompensated above grid). TopoSCALE performs better below grid level, possibly due to lower absolute<br>Ws magnitudes leading to lower error values.<br>Looking only at surface data (red-box), pressure-levelbased results (i.e. TopoSCALE) outperform surface databased results (i.e. GRID and REF) in all cases but most significantly in T and Ws. This is quite surprising as it would<br>seem likely that the surface data should contain more of the<br>boundary layer effect (cf. Sect. 6.3). However, this indicates<br>that TopoSCALE could also be usefully applied in locations<br>close to grid level without reduced quality over surface-based<br>data.<br>6 Discussion<br>Reanalyses are complex products in that they combine a climate model with observations. This section provides a discussion of key issues relevant to the use of reanalysis and<br>other climate data sets, in order to place this study and results<br>in context, as well as to highlight some important limitations<br>to this approach.<br>6.1 Assimilation issues<br>Reanalyses assimilate a large number of observations in spatially and temporally varying quantities and densities. It is<br>therefore important to know which observational data sets<br>are assimilated into the ERA-I product, as this not only affects how independent observations are in terms of validation, but will also suggest how the performance of ERA-I<br>(and therefore TopoSCALE) can vary with observation density. Assimilated data that is also used for evaluation in this<br>study originates from the SYNOP registered MeteoSchweiz<br>stations (a subset of the ANETZ network), and only affects<br>observations of air temperature and relative humidity (Table 1). Furthermore, for screen-level analysis (2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity) surface observations that differ<br>by more that 300 m from the model orography are rejected in<br>the ERA-I assimilation.<br>6.2 Bias and spatial-temporal variability of errors<br>LSM results are sensitive to bias in climate data (e.g. Berg,<br>2003), which may result in unrealistic estimates of mass,<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Performance of TopoSCALE precipitation at monthly and annual scales compared to GRID and REF. The description of the spatial<br>distribution of precipitation included in TopoSCALE gives improvements over a purely lapse-rate-based approach (REF).<br>energy, momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and<br>surface (Maurer et al., 2001a, b). Therefore, bias correction<br>is usually regarded as a crucial step in providing accurate<br>driving fields to a land-surface or impact model (Hagemann<br>et al., 2011). In this study we have chosen to conceptually<br>separate “bias” and “scale” (often combined in downscaling routines based on station data) in order to focus on the<br>problem of topography-based scaling, as this is not reliant<br>on observational data sets. Therefore, the treatment of bias<br>can be performed in a second step with a reduced influence<br>of scale differences. However, we acknowledge that bias correction is often necessary to provide accurate fields to surface<br>models. Reanalysis can be seen as an imperfect model combined with incomplete data and output should not be equated<br>with “observations” or “reality”. The changing mix of observations, and biases in observations and models, can introduce spurious variability and trends into reanalysis output. Observational constraints, and therefore reanalysis reliability, can vary considerably depending on the location,<br>time-period, and variable considered. Another problem is<br>that mixing observations with models tends to violate conservation laws. Most significant to this study is the fact that<br>reanalysis will likely be closer to reality at locations with<br>higher observation densities (i.e Europe and specifically the<br>European Alps, in contrast to other high-mountain regions).<br>6.3 Subgrid issues and boundary-layer effects<br>Due to the coarse resolution of current reanalysis data sets<br>(typically 0.75 ◦–1.5 ◦<br>), various processes are unresolved by<br>the model. An important example is temperature inversion<br>in mountain valleys, which will not be captured by the data.<br>Another important process is local-scale rain shadows caused<br>by unresolved topographic barriers and shallow convection<br>which is parameterised by a bulk mass flux scheme in the<br>ECWMF model (Tiedtke, 1989), and therefore cannot resolve the level of spatial differentiation that is present in surface measurements. The surface boundary layer (as opposed<br>atmospheric boundary layer) will have a residual effect upon<br>surface measurements, which will not necessarily be present<br>Geosci.

TopoSCALE given by solid line, OBS given by dashed line.<br>in pressure levels representing the free atmosphere. For example, turbulent exchanges of sensible heat fluxes can be<br>a significant contributor to energy exchange between surface<br>and atmosphere (Cline, 1997; Helgason and Pomeroy, 2012).<br>These effects will also likely affect diurnal cycles of observations. However, the magnitude of these effects is not quantified by this study.<br>7 Conclusions<br>This study has proposed a method that can efficiently provide<br>meteorological variables to an LSM operating at high resolution in complex terrain. In addition, it provides a means to<br>generate driving data in remote areas due to non-reliance on<br>measurements. The schemes focus is on variables that can<br>be derived from pressure-level data, however, surface fields<br>are also computed in order to provide a consistent set of<br>driving meteorology required by an LSM. Important limitations of the approach are described in Sect. 6 but can be<br>summarised as related to (1) assimilation issues (i.e. possible reduction in performance in data-poor areas), (2) reduced<br>performance below grid-level (although this is not universal in gridded data sets), (3) bias in gridded climate data,<br>and (4) subgrid phenomena that are not resolved by the input data (such as temperature inversions). Specifically, in<br>terms of variables computed in this study, strong improvements in the subgrid radiation scheme would likely result<br>from the availability of radiative fluxes (LW↓, SW↓<br>dir and<br>SW↓<br>dif) on pressure levels. The benefit of such an improved<br>description of vertical profiles and diffuse/direct partitioning<br>would be of great relevance as large areas globally are subject to rugged topography (cf. Gruber, 2012; Körner et al.,<br>2011; Meybeck et al., 2001). As an outlook, partitioned SW↓<br>components are now archived in the current ECWMF operational model (ECWMF, personal communication, 2012), so<br>will likely be available in future generations of reanalysis,<br>but possibly only at the surface. Precipitation could be improved by a more rigorous sub-model such as that proposed<br>by, for example, Smith and Barstad (2004). We attempt to<br>account for subgrid orographic effects such as rain-shadows<br>by implementing a description of variability through a climatology, but this is dependent on the quality of the climatology data set. However, the next generation of reanalysis (e.g. ERA-20C) are likely to deliver large improvements<br>in this respect due to higher model resolutions improving<br>the representation of orographic precipitation. Additionally,<br>when used with RCM (e.g. CORDEX, the first globally integrated RCM project) or weather model it is expected that<br>precipitation-based error would be reduced significantly. In<br>sum, the core strengths of the scheme we have described in<br>this study are the following:<br>1. Generally demonstrates improved skill in downscaling<br>climate data in complex terrain, as compared to reference methods and good performance when evaluated<br>against measurements. This result is most pronounced<br>in pressure-level variables.<br>2. Provides a means to generate downscaled data when<br>statistical methods are not possible i.e. in remote, datapoor areas or future time-periods.<br>3. Provides spatially and temporally continuous meteorological fields at point-scale which are physically consistent.<br>4. Is efficient and therefore can be used to derive long<br>time series or data over large areas.<br>However, it is recognised that this method has been developed and tested in a particular climatic zone (temperate,<br>moist) and requires testing elsewhere to determine broader<br>suitability.<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Fiddes (joel.fiddes@geo.uzh.ch)<br>Received: 26 April 2013 – Published in Geosci. Model Dev. Discuss.: 26 June 2013<br>Revised: 6 November 2013 – Accepted: 30 December 2013 – Published: 21 February 2014<br>Abstract. Simulation of land surface processes is problematic in heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution<br>required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability<br>caused by, for example, topography, and the lack of accurate<br>meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required.<br>Gridded data products produced by atmospheric models can<br>fill this gap, however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations. In this study we<br>describe a method that uses the well-resolved description<br>of the atmospheric column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs),<br>to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale<br>subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide highresolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM).<br>The method makes use of an interpolation of pressurelevel data according to topographic height of the subgrid.<br>An elevation and topography correction is used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity<br>at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative<br>humidity fields to describe variability with elevation. Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach.<br>We test the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level<br>data and a set of reference methods, against a large evaluation<br>dataset (up to 210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps.<br>We demonstrate that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in complex terrain, with most significant<br>improvements (with respect to reference methods) seen in<br>variables derived from pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and incoming long-wave radiation.<br>This method may be of use in improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are not possible, due to lack<br>of observations (i.e. remote areas or future periods).<br>1 Introduction<br>Simulations of land-surface processes are important for performing assessments of a wide range of earth systems, under current and possible future climates. This task is problematic in complex terrain due to the inter-connected problems of (i) the high resolution required of model grids to<br>capture strong lateral variability caused by, for example, topography, surface or sub-surface processes (e.g. Gubler et al.,<br>2011; Riseborough et al., 2008; Arnold and Rees, 2009); and<br>consequently, (ii) the lack of accurate meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required (Thornton et al.,<br>1997; Liston and Elder, 2006). This can be due to the lack of<br>meteorological observations (i.e. spatial coverage, temporal<br>extent/continuity, or variables measured are insufficient for<br>purpose) or lack of representative observations where surface variability is high. Gridded data products produced by<br>atmospheric models can, in part, fill this gap (e.g. Frauenfeld, 2005; Pereira-Cardenal et al., 2011; Akhtar et al., 2009;<br>Vu et al., 2012); however, in many cases not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations (i.e.<br>site scale), and therefore require some form of downscaling<br>of variables.<br>Basic downscaling approaches (also referred to as disaggregation), utilise fixed relationships between the coarsegrid fields of atmospheric models and a subgrid surface,<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>388 J. Fiddes and S. Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain<br>that describes a given variable at higher resolution than the<br>coarse-grid. Such approaches developed from the recognised<br>need to represent subgrid surface heterogeneity in climate<br>models and therefore the requirement to disaggregate the<br>coarse-grid climate forcing to the subgrid land-surface (e.g.<br>Dickinson et al., 1986; Wood, 1992; Koster and Suarez,<br>1992; Seth et al., 1994). For example, Giorgi et al. (2003)<br>and Dimri (2009) downscale the temperature field according<br>to the subgrid elevation and a fixed lapse rate. In a coupled<br>system it is important that the coarse-grid mean is conserved<br>by such approaches (Giorgi et al., 2003). More complex approaches to downscaling of climate data can be broadly divided into dynamical or statistical methods (Schmidli et al.,<br>2007) which are used to increase the resolution of largescale climate fields (see for full discussion Wilby and Wigley<br>(1997)). Dynamical methods achieve this by using a limited<br>area model at a higher grid resolution e.g. a regional climate model (RCM), to simulate fine-scale processes which<br>are consistent with large-scale climate fields (Giorgi, 2006).<br>While an RCM grid resolution could be increased further, in<br>practice the effective resolution is limited by the complexity<br>of the numerics that must be solved at each model time step,<br>to the order of 101 km (Kotlarski and Block, 2005). Statistical<br>methods derive empirical relationships between large-scale<br>predictor fields and local observations (Maraun and Wetterhall, 2010). These methods are computationally efficient<br>but the coverage and effective resolution is often limited by<br>the density of observations, especially in mountainous (i.e.<br>data-poor) areas. Additionally, it is unknown whether empirically derived relationships are valid outside the time window used for calibration. To compliment these approaches<br>there is a growing number of physically inspired, computationally efficient approaches that use physical relationships<br>and high-resolution surface information, that is, digital elevation models (DEMs), to distribute fine-scale forcings (meteorological stations or coarse-grid centre point) over wide<br>areas (e.g. Liston and Elder, 2006; Tarboton and Luce, 1996;<br>Marks et al., 1999; Jarosch et al., 2012). These distributed<br>forcings can then be used for full 2-D, point scale or lumped<br>model simulations.<br>Another interesting statistical approach presented by<br>Schomburg et al. (2012) utilises empirical relationships between the atmospheric coarse field and high-resolution surface data to disaggregate variables. The main aim of this<br>work was to improve the forcing of soil–vegetation transfer<br>models either in offline simulations or fully coupled model<br>systems. However, the emphasis of this work is on improving the representation of the land surface, via a distributed<br>forcing, within climate models; moreover, the scheme resolution of 400 m would be too coarse to resolve many surface<br>processes in mountain areas.<br>In complex terrain, topography-based gradients of meteorological variables (i.e. related to elevation, aspect, slope,<br>etc.) can often dominate over horizontal gradients (i.e. latitude/longitude) within a region that is of comparable size<br>to a typical coarse climate cell (e.g. 50–100 km). An example of a method that has successfully encoded this assumption is the PRISM framework (parameter–elevation regressions on independent slopes model) which provides a statistical, topography-based mapping of climate observations<br>(Daly et al., 1994, 2002). We do not neglect the fact that<br>other forms of heterogeneity may be important in modifying surface fluxes, such as surface cover, but it is important<br>to distinguish between surface heterogeneity that clearly affects atmospheric forcing, e.g. the effect of elevation on air<br>temperature, and those characteristics that become important<br>when performing a coupled land-surface–atmosphere simulation (e.g. the effect of soil properties on near-surface air<br>temperature).<br>Climate models provide spatially and temporally continuous fields which are physically consistent and therefore are<br>useful tools for forcing regional-scale land-surface studies<br>(Machguth et al., 2009; Kotlarski et al., 2010). In addition,<br>they provide a thorough description of the atmospheric column by providing data fields at many pressure levels between<br>the earth’s surface and top of the atmosphere.<br>The aim of this study is to develop methods that use<br>the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column<br>provided by climate models, together with high-resolution<br>DEMs, to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a finescale subgrid. The main motivation of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model<br>(LSM), understood here as any process-based surface model<br>that simulates the interface of the land surface/subsurface–<br>atmosphere system. Additionally, the approach should be<br>consistent (methodologically, spatially, temporally) and not<br>reliant on observations. Therefore, the design criteria for this<br>method are (1) it provides high-resolution (< 100 m) downscaling of climate data based primarily on DEM-based information; (2) it is as physically based as possible and therefore has minimal reliance on observations and likely remains<br>valid under future conditions; (3) it employs simple methods<br>which are computationally efficient; (4) it may be used as<br>part of a modelling chain with a lumped representation of the<br>subgrid domain (e.g. Fiddes and Gruber, 2012) for large area<br>applications, as well as 1-D points and 2-D grids. Our approach therefore largely assumes vertical gradients to dominate horizontal gradients within a given model grid box. In<br>this study, we describe this method and its application with<br>ERA-Interim data, a 4-D-VAR reanalysis (3rd generation)<br>which uses the ECMWF climate model, although the method<br>could be equally used with other reanalyses (e.g. NARR,<br>NCEP/NCAR, JRA-55, NASA MERRA, or RCM derived<br>fields). Our methods are then evaluated against a large number of observations over a wide area of complex terrain in<br>the European Alps as well as compared to a set of reference<br>methods. The methods proposed here aim to provide an alternative to statistical methods when observations are not available (remote areas or future periods) and be complimentary<br>Geosci.

The ERA-Interim data assimilation system contains many improvements both in the forecasting model and<br>analysis methodology relative to ECMWF’s previous reanalysis, ERA-40, including the use of 4-dimensional variational analysis, a revised humidity analysis, the use of variational bias correction for satellite data, and other improvements in data handling (Dee et al., 2011). ERA-I provides<br>meteorological data from 1 January 1979 and continues to<br>be extended in near-real time. Gridded products include<br>a large variety of 3-hourly (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00,<br>15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 UTC) grid-surface fields (GRID)<br>and 6-hourly (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC) upperatmosphere products available on 60 pressure levels (PL)<br>with top of the atmosphere located at 1 mb. ERA-I relies on<br>a 4-D-VAR system which uses observations within the windows of 15:00–03:00 UTC and 03:00–15:00 UTC (in the next<br>day) to initialise forecast simulations starting at 00:00 UTC<br>and 12:00 UTC, respectively. In order to allow sufficient<br>spin-up, the first nine hours of the forecast simulations are<br>not used. All fields used in this study where extracted on the<br>ECMWF reduced Gaussian N128 grid (0.75◦ × 0.75◦<br>). Six<br>PLs are used in this study covering the range of 1000–500 mb<br>(1000, 925, 850, 775, 650, 500), corresponding to approximately an elevation range of 150–5500 m a.s.l. ERA-I fields<br>used are listed in Table 1.<br>2.2 Pressure levels below model surface<br>While ERA-I model levels are computed from the model<br>orography surface to top of the atmosphere, pressure-level<br>data is given in the interval 1000 mb (approximately sealevel)–1 mb (top of atmosphere). This means that pressurelevel data exist below the model-grid surface in regions with<br>rugged topography. The extrapolation of fields below the surface uses different methods to those above the model surface. For example, geopotential is extrapolated below the<br>model surface as a function of surface geopotential, surface temperature, temperature at mean sea level, surface<br>pressure and pressure-level value. Temperature is extrapolated below the model surface to a given pressure level as<br>a quadratic function of surface temperature, surface pressure and pressure-level value. Wind and relative humidity are<br>both constant below model surface and equal to the lowest<br>model level values (ECMWF, 2011). Additionally a greater<br>quantity of data is assimilated from above surface observations. Therefore, it can be expected that there is a difference in quality of above/below grid pressure-level data. In<br>addition, measurement locations below grid level are more<br>likely to be in valleys and therefore there will be greater exposure of observations to subgrid processes, not represented<br>by the data. See ECMWF (2011) for full details of extrapolation methods. However, it is difficult to disentangle this effect<br>from the fact that measurements above the model surface are<br>more likely to represent the free atmosphere and, therefore,<br>be more accurately simulated than those strongly effected by<br>topographic effects (e.g. Mesinger et al., 2006; Jarosch et al.,<br>2012) such as inversion layers or topographically modified<br>wind fields. This issue is addressed in the results section.<br>2.3 Evaluation data sets<br>See Table 1 for an overview (by variable) of the evaluation<br>(OBS) data sets used in this study. The MeteoSwiss automatic meteorological network (ANETZ) covers 40 stations<br>(hourly data) ranging 1132–3580 m a.s.l. and represents both<br>high mountain locations and valleys. The IMIS station network of the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research<br>is biased towards high alpine locations (there are few valley<br>stations) but represents topographical heterogeneity in terms<br>of slope and aspect more comprehensively than ANETZ stations. Network elevation range is 1562–3341 m a.s.l. Tenminute measurements from the Alpine Surface Radiation<br>Budget network (ASRB) (Marty et al., 2002) network has<br>9 stations ranging 370–3580 m a.s.l. All OBS data sources<br>where aggregated to daily mean values to enable comparison with ERA-I fields at a common resolution. An additional<br>analysis on diurnal cycles required aggregation at 3-hourly<br>time steps. See Fig. 1 for the locations all stations used in<br>this study and elevation distribution of stations by variable.<br>See Sect. 6.1 for assimilation issues related to evaluation data<br>sets.<br>2.4 Precipitation climatology<br>The CRU Alpine precipitation data set (hereafter referred to<br>as CRU) is used as a climatology in the precipitation scheme.<br>It provides monthly precipitation totals, for the period 1800–<br>2003, gridded at 10 arc-min resolution over the Alpine region. The data set is based on 192 long-term homogenized<br>precipitation series from meteorological stations across the<br>study domain and a high-resolution precipitation climatology for the period 1971–1990. Full details are available in<br>Efthymiadis et al. (2006).<br>2.5 Data quality control<br>OBS values outside acceptable limits were removed automatically by applying physically plausible thresholds to all<br>data sets.

Input pressure-level fields used are, air temperature (Tpl), relative humidity (Rhpl), wind components U and<br>V , which are converted to wind speed (Wspl). Input gridsurface fields are downwelling global radiation (SW↓grid),<br>downwelling long-wave radiation (LW↓grid) and precipitation (Pgrid).

To perform the wind modification calculations, the local slope, aspect, and topographic<br>curvature (a measure of relative prominence with respect to<br>surrounding terrain) are required (Appendix C2).<br>3.1.2 Radiative fluxes<br>LW↓sub is computed by deriving a cloud component of allsky emissivity at grid level and using Tsub, Rhsub to describe variability with elevation. First, clear-sky emissivity<br>at SUB (<br>cl<br>sub) and GRID (<br>cl<br>grid) are computed according to<br>Konzelmann et al. (1994):<br><br>cl<br>sub/grid = 0.23 + x1(pVsub/grid/Tsub/grid)<br>1/x2<br>, (1)<br>where x1 = 0.43 and x2 = 5.7 (Gubler et al., 2012) and water vapour pressure, pV is a function of Rh (Appendix C3).<br>The all-sky emissivity is computed at GRID using LW↓grid<br>and the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:<br><br>as<br>grid = LW ↓grid /σ T 4<br>grid, (2)<br>where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant of 5.67 ×<br>10−8<br>Js−1 m−2 K<br>−4<br>. We estimate the cloud-based component of emissivity (1) at GRID though subtraction of <br>cl<br>grid<br>from <br>as<br>grid in order to apply this correction directly at SUB.<br>Finally, LW ↓sub can be computed accounting for elevation<br>changes in T and Rh by<br>LW ↓sub=<br><br><br>cl<br>sub + 1<br>σ T 4<br>sub. (3)<br>This approach assumes that cloud emissivity at GRID and<br>SUB elevations are the same, but accounts for reduction of<br>clear-sky emissivity with elevation. This is important as the<br>steepest gradients in LW↓ are often found in clear-sky conditions due to reduction in atmospheric water vapour with<br>elevation. After elevation correction, terrain effects are accounted for by reduction of LW↓sub by multiplication with<br>the sky-view factor, being the fraction of sky that is visible at<br>SUB (Vd). This assumes that LW↓ is isotropic.<br>SW↓sub is computed in a three-step process: (1) partitioning of SW↓grid into direct and diffuse components, (2) elevation adjustment of direct, and (3) topographic correction of<br>both diffuse and direct at point scale. SW↓grid can be partitioned into direct (SW↓<br>dir<br>grid) and and diffuse (SW↓<br>dif<br>grid) components according to the hourly regression model of RuizArias et al. (2010b) which has been developed based on 21<br>stations in Europe and USA (Appendix ). This method uses<br>the clearness index, which is computed by ratioing SW↓grid<br>against irradiance at top of atmosphere, SW↓toa and in doing<br>so estimates a solar transmissivity of the atmospheric column (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that the regression model<br>was developed on hourly data, whereas we apply it to 3 h<br>averages. The vertical gradient of global irradiance between<br>GRID and SUB is mainly determined by the direct component together with difference in the optical path length 1m,<br>assuming that attenuative properties of the atmosphere are<br>constant between the two elevations. Therefore, we apply an<br>elevation correction to SW↓<br>dir<br>grid only, largely following methods of Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010b) (Fig. 3b). First, 1m is computed as<br>1m = 1z cos θz, (4)<br>where 1z is difference in elevation and θz is the solar zenith<br>angle. We can then solve the Beer–Lambert law for direct<br>irradiance to obtain the broadband attenuation coefficient (k):<br>SW ↓<br>dir= SW ↓<br>toa e<br>−km, (5)<br>where m = 1/cos θz (except for large values of θz). The difference in SW↓<br>dir due to elevation difference between GRID<br>and SUB can then be found as<br>1SW ↓<br>dir<br>SW ↓dir ≈ 1 − e<br>−k1z cos θz<br>. (6)<br>Equation (6) shows direct irradiance should increase exponentially with elevation given constant k and elevation-based<br>change in irradiance is maximum when sun is at zenith and<br>zero when sun is at horizon. As the correction is only applicable to clear-sky conditions, it is applied when the air-masscorrected clearness index kt<br>is greater than 0.65 (Perez et al.,<br>1990).<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain 393<br>3.1.3 Precipitation<br>Precipitation patterns in mountain regions are driven by<br>a range of complex mechanisms which depend upon, for<br>example, season, geographical climate (maritime, continental) and structure of orography (Leung and Ghan, 1995;<br>Lundquist et al., 2010; Smith and Barstad, 2004). Precipitation is therefore strongly variable in both time and space.<br>Figure 4 gives an overview of the combined climatology and<br>lapse rate approach used to address this problem (e.g. Früh<br>et al., 2006). It should be noted that this routine can also be<br>implemented using only the lapse rate, in order to remove<br>any dependency on climatology data. We acknowledge that<br>the quality of the data set is heavily dependent on density of<br>observations and therefore, better than average results should<br>be expected in our study domain.<br>First, the elevation signal of the climatology data is removed by dividing by the non-linear lapse rate (λp) of Liston<br>and Elder (2006) (Appendix C5), and then normalising to<br>the GRID reference elevation. Pgrid is then disaggregated according to the subgrid variability as described by the normalised climatology (now elevation independent). Each of<br>the ith (in this study 1–25) climatology grid-cells Pclim are<br>normalised by the sum of Pclim contained in each ERA<br>course grid box, resulting in a subgrid disaggregation factor<br>Wsub,<br>Wsub = P<br>i<br>clim /<br>XPclim. (11)<br>In this study we use the CRU climatology but other sources<br>of subgrid observations could be used. Globally, or near globally available data sets (gauge and satellite based) include the<br>Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (Huffman et al., 2007),<br>Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (Beck et al., 2005)<br>and Climatic Research Unit (New et al., 2002) or regionally available such as PRISM (Daly et al., 1994) or even<br>direct observations if available. The product of Pgrid and<br>Wsub generates a subgrid distribution of precipitation at the<br>climatology resolution, that is conservative of the coarsegrid forcing Pgrid. Finally, λp is applied to capture fine-scale<br>precipitation-elevation gradients in order to obtain Psub,<br>Psub = Pgrid · Wsub · λp. (12)<br>It should be noted that this method simply applies a scaling<br>to the precipitation field and does not estimate the precipitation phase (snow–rain partition), this is done by the model<br>which the precipitation field is used to drive.<br>3.2 Reference methods<br>The following is a description of the reference parameterisations with which we compare the current scheme. We do not<br>intend this comparison to be exhaustive, but to merely serve<br>as a reference point, based on common parameterisations.<br>Tgrid is simply extrapolated according to a fixed lapse of<br>6.5 ◦C km−1<br>(e.g. Blandford et al., 2008). Rh is not a linear<br>function of elevation and so the relatively linear dew point<br>temperature (Td) is often used (Liston and Elder, 2006). Rh<br>can be converted to Td as a function of T and pV. In this<br>study Tdgrid is available, so this step is unnecessary.<br>Tdsub can be computed using a variable lapse rate (Kunkel,<br>1989):<br>lapse = λ · c/b, (13)<br>where λ is a vapour pressure coefficient that varies during<br>each month of the year (Kunkel, 1989) and constants b =<br>22.452, c = 272.55 ◦C are given by Buck (1981). Finally,<br>Tdsub is then converted back to Rhsub as a function of Tsub.<br>LW↓ is parameterised as a function of T and pV and cloud<br>cover according to the clear-sky formula of Konzelmann<br>et al.

(1), N is given by the ERA-I total<br>cloud product (0–1), p1 = 6, p2 = 4 and <br>as = 0.979. Wind<br>is adjusted by 40 % per km (i.e increased above grid level<br>reduced below grid level) (Plüss, 1997). SW↓ is not compared to a reference method as the methods (i.e. partitioning,<br>elevation and topographic correction) used in this study are<br>commonly used elsewhere (i.e. Oliphant, 2003; Schroeder<br>et al., 2009). Precipitation is scaled with a non-linear lapse<br>rate (Liston and Elder, 2006).<br>4 Experiments<br>4.1 Location<br>The study region contains the entire Swiss Alps and uses 19<br>ERA-I grid boxes to cover all observations that are used to<br>evaluate the methods. Switzerland contains one of the most<br>densely observed mountain regions in the world and, therefore, is a suitable region within which to evaluate this method<br>and specifically its performance with respect to vertical information, as it covers a large elevation gradient of 195–<br>4634 m a.s.l.

(15)<br>5 Results<br>In this section results are presented as follows: (1) pressurelevel-based results (T , Rh, Ws, LW↓); (2) surface-based results (SW↓ and precipitation); (3) seasonal error signatures;<br>(4) diurnal cycles; and (5) elevation effects, both absolute and<br>relative to grid level.<br>5.1 Pressure-level-based results<br>Figure 5 gives density scatter plots for the validation data set<br>(OBS) against GRID, REF and TopoSCALE results (MOD)<br>of variables computed based on pressure-level data (with exception of SW↓). A density plot is used because of the large<br>number of points plotted (e.g. ∼ 106<br>in the case of T ).<br>For T , (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant<br>improvement in R, RMSE and BIAS of T with respect<br>to observations. Applying a fixed lapse rate (REF) improves the RMSE by 0.75 ◦C over grid level values whereas<br>TopoSCALE improves RMSE by 2.66 ◦C. The BIAS in REF<br>(1.5) is similar to GRID (1.62), whereas TopoSCALE significantly improves this (−0.02). Bias in TopoSCALE is concentrated at extremes of temperature (i.e. low temperatures<br>are too high and high temperatures are too low).<br>For Rh (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant improvement in the correlation and modest improvement in<br>RMSE (due to the poorly performing cluster at high humidity). There appears to be a high degree of uncertainty in saturated conditions (i.e. measurements at or close to 100 %) in<br>all cases. TopoSCALE shows significant improvement over<br>GRID and REF (approximately the same performance) particular in the interval 0–60 % which is significant for processes such as sublimation which occur in dry atmospheric<br>conditions. Both GRID and REF seem unable to represent<br>humidities less than 30 %. This could possibly be that dry<br>(often well below 30% humidity) Foehn winds are represented in the pressure-level data but absent from surface data.<br>Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series that are possibly related to changing patterns of data<br>assimilation (Fig. 7a). At least one of these artefacts fits<br>to a major data introduction (European wind profilers in<br>2002). Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted to a three<br>year period (1996–1998) that was stable. Comparison of<br>distributions of wind speed show a large improvement of<br>TopoSCALE over GRID especially in the R value and BIAS.<br>There is still a large degree of scatter especially at high wind<br>speeds. The most significant result is an improvement in<br>BIAS with a shift of the distribution to the 1 : 1 line, while<br>the GRID data is not able to represent values greater than<br>5 ms−1<br>.<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●●<br>●<br>●<br>● ● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●
