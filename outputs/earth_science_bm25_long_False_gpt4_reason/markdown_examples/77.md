### Essential Problem

The core issue here revolves around understanding why, despite the significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industries amounting to about 1.5 billion metric tons annually in the United States alone, CO2 still constitutes a relatively small fraction (approximately 0.04%) of the Earth's atmosphere.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Composition of the Atmosphere**: The Earth's atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), with the remaining 1% consisting of argon, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. The small percentage of CO2 needs to be considered in the context of this broader atmospheric composition.

2. **Natural Carbon Cycle**: The Earth has a natural carbon cycle that involves the absorption and release of CO2 by oceans, plants, and soil. This cycle helps to regulate the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Plants, for example, absorb CO2 during photosynthesis, which can mitigate some of the impacts of industrial emissions.

3. **Historical Levels of CO2**: It's important to note that while the current percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere might seem small, it has increased significantly over the past centuries. Before the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 levels were about 280 parts per million (ppm), and they have now risen to over 400 ppm. This increase is substantial in the context of the Earth's climate system.

4. **Impact of CO2 on Global Warming**: Despite its relatively small concentration, CO2 is a potent greenhouse gas. This means it is very effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. The impact of CO2 on the Earth's climate is disproportionate to its concentration in the atmosphere.

5. **Scale of the Atmosphere**: The Earth's atmosphere is vast, and the annual emissions of CO2, while large, are distributed throughout this massive volume. The scale of the atmosphere can make even large quantities of emissions seem small in percentage terms.

6. **Ongoing Emissions and Accumulation**: It's also crucial to understand that the problem is not just the annual emissions but the cumulative effect of CO2 emissions over time. CO2 has a long atmospheric lifetime, ranging from hundreds to thousands of years, meaning that it accumulates in the atmosphere, gradually increasing its concentration and impact.

### Detailed Answer

Despite the substantial annual industrial emissions of CO2 in the United States and globally, CO2 constitutes a relatively minor fraction of the Earth's atmosphere due to several key factors. The atmosphere's composition is dominated by nitrogen and oxygen, with CO2 and other gases making up a small percentage. The natural carbon cycle plays a crucial role in regulating CO2 levels, though human activities have significantly altered this balance, leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 from pre-industrial levels.

The impact of CO2 on global warming is significant, despite its small concentration, because of its efficiency as a greenhouse gas. This underscores the importance of considering not just the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere, but its absolute levels, rate of increase, and the cumulative effect of emissions over time. The vast scale of the Earth's atmosphere can dilute annual emissions, but the ongoing accumulation of CO2 poses a long-term challenge for climate regulation and mitigation efforts.

It is one of several greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of Earth. The current global average concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is 421 ppm as of May 2022 (0.04%).[78] This is an increase of 50% since the start of the Industrial Revolution, up from 280 ppm during the 10,000 years prior to the mid-18th century.[79][78

> part3 -------------------<br>Positive feedbacks through the carbon cycle[edit]<br><br>See also: Carbon cycle<br>The global warming projections contained in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) include carbon cycle feedbacks. Authors of AR4, however, noted that scientific understanding of carbon cycle feedbacks was poor. Projections in AR4 were based on a range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and suggested warming between the late 20th and late 21st century of 1.1 to 6.4 °C. This is the "likely" range (greater than 66% probability), based on the expert judgement of the IPCC's authors. Authors noted that the lower end of the "likely" range appeared to be better constrained than the upper end of the "likely" range, in part due to carbon cycle feedbacks. The American Meteorological Society has commented that more research is needed to model the effects of carbon cycle feedbacks in climate change projections.<br>There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming. All 11 models in the C4MIP study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular (HadCM3) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the Amazon Rainforest in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming.<br>Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year).<br>It has also been suggested (by Chris Freeman) that the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat bogs into water courses (from which it would in turn enter the atmosphere) constitutes a positive feedback for global warming. The carbon currently stored in peatlands (390–455 gigatonnes, one-third of the total land-based carbon store) is over half the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere. DOC levels in water courses are observably rising; Freeman's hypothesis is that, not elevated temperatures, but elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are responsible, through stimulation of primary productivity.<br>Tree deaths are believed to be increasing as a result of climate change, which is a positive feedback effect.<br>Methane climate feedbacks in natural ecosystems.<br>Wetlands and freshwater ecosystems are predicted to be the largest potential contributor to a global methane climate feedback. Long-term warming changes the balance in the methane-related microbial community within freshwater ecosystems so they produce more methane while proportionately less is oxidised to carbon dioxide.<br>Arctic methane release[edit]<br>Photo shows what appears to be permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay, Canada, near Greenland. (2008) Global warming will increase permafrost and peatland thaw, which can result in collapse of plateau surfaces.<br><br>Main article: Arctic methane release<br>Warming is also the triggering variable for the release of carbon (potentially as methane) in the arctic. Methane released from thawing permafrost such as the frozen peat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates a positive feedback. In April 2019, Turetsky et al. reported permafrost was thawing quicker than predicted. Recently the understanding of the climate feedback from permafrost improved, but potential emissions from the subsea permafrost remain unknown and are - like many other soil carbon feedbacks - still absent from most climate models.<br>Thawing permafrost[edit]<br><br>See also: Permafrost thaw, Permafrost carbon cycle, and Arctic methane release<br>Western Siberia is the world's largest peat bog, a one million square kilometer region of permafrost peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The thawing of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of methane. As much as 70,000 million tonnes of methane, an extremely effective greenhouse gas, might be released over the next few decades, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar thawing has been observed in eastern Siberia. Lawrence et al. (2008) suggest that a rapid melting of Arctic sea ice may start a feedback loop that rapidly melts Arctic permafrost, triggering further warming. May 31, 2010. NASA published that globally "Greenhouse gases are escaping the permafrost and entering the atmosphere at an increasing rate - up to 50 billion tons each year of methane, for example - due to a global thawing trend. This is particularly troublesome because methane heats the atmosphere with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide" (the equivalent of 1250 billion tons of CO2 per year).<br>Researchers have also analysed how carbon released from permafrost might contribute to global warming. A study from 2011 projected changes in permafrost based on a medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SRES A1B). According to the study, by 2200, the permafrost feedback might contribute 190 (+/- 64) gigatons of carbon cumulatively to the atmosphere.<br>In 2019, a report called " Arctic report card " estimated the current greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic permafrost as almost equal to the emissions of Russia or Japan or less than 10% of the global emissions from fossil fuels.<br>The Sixth IPCC Assessment Report states that "projections from models of permafrost ecosystems suggest that future permafrost thaw will lead to some additional warming – enough to be important, but not enough to lead to a 'runaway warming' situation, where permafrost thaw leads to a dramatic, self-reinforcing acceleration of global warming."<br>Hydrates[edit]<br><br>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis<br>Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the sea and ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a climate tipping event, has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmosphere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and also the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate change event. In 2008, a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed permafrost, around the outfall of the Lena River and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.<br>In 2020, the first leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica was discovered. The scientists are not sure what caused it. The area where it was found had not warmed yet significantly. It is on the side of a volcano, but it seems that it is not from there. The methane-eating microbes consume much less methane than was supposed, and the researchers think this should be included in climate models. They also claim that there is much more to discover about the issue in Antarctica. A quarter of all marine methane is found in the region of Antarctica<br>Abrupt increases in atmospheric methane[edit]<br>Literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) have considered the possibility of future projected climate change leading to a rapid increase in atmospheric methane. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, looked at possible rapid increases in methane due either to reductions in the atmospheric chemical sink or from the release of buried methane reservoirs. In both cases, it was judged that such a release would be "exceptionally unlikely"<br>(less than a 1% chance, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, published in 2008, concluded that an abrupt release of methane into the atmosphere appeared "very unlikely"<br>(less than 10% probability, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, however, noted that climate change would "very likely" (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) accelerate the pace of persistent emissions from both hydrate sources and wetlands.<br>On 10 June 2019 Louise M. Farquharson and her team reported that their 12-year study into Canadian permafrost had "Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090. Between 1990 and 2016, an increase of up to 4 °C has been observed in terrestrial permafrost and this trend is expected to continue as Arctic mean annual air temperatures increase at a rate twice that of lower latitudes." Determining the extent of new thermokarst development is difficult, but there is little doubt the problem is widespread. Farquharson and her team guess that about 231,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers) of permafrost, or about 5.5% of the zone that is permafrost year-round, is vulnerable to rapid surface thawing.<br>Decomposition[edit]<br><br>Main article: Decomposition<br>Organic matter stored in permafrost generates heat as it decomposes in response to the permafrost thawing. The amount of carbon stored in the permafrost region is estimated to be around two times the amount of carbon that is in the Earth's atmosphere. As the tropics get wetter, as many climate models predict, soils are likely to experience greater rates of respiration and decomposition, limiting the carbon storage abilities of tropical soils.<br>Peat decomposition[edit]<br>Peat, occurring naturally in peat bogs, is a store of carbon significant on a global scale. When peat dries it decomposes, and may additionally burn. Water table adjustment due to global warming may cause significant excursions of carbon from peat bogs.  This may be released as methane, which can exacerbate the feedback effect, due to its high global warming potential.<br>Rainforest drying[edit]<br>Rainforests, most notably tropical rainforests, are particularly vulnerable to global warming.  There are a number of effects which may occur, but two are particularly concerning.  Firstly, the drier vegetation may cause total collapse of the rainforest ecosystem.  For example, the Amazon rainforest would tend to be replaced by caatinga ecosystems.  Further, even tropical rainforests ecosystems which do not collapse entirely may lose significant proportions of their stored carbon as a result of drying, due to changes in vegetation.<br>Forest fires[edit]<br><br>See also: Wildfire § Climate change effects, and Effects of climate change on biomes<br>The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predicts that many mid-latitude regions, such as Mediterranean Europe, will experience decreased rainfall and an increased risk of drought, which in turn would allow forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.  Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the Amazon Rainforest, eventually resulting in a transition to Caatinga vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region.<br>Desertification[edit]<br>Desertification is a consequence of global warming in some environments.  Desert soils contain little humus, and support little vegetation.  As a result, transition to desert ecosystems is typically associated with excursions of carbon.

Observations over the past six decades show that the airborne fraction has remained relatively stable at around 45%.[2] This indicates that the land and ocean's capacity to absorb CO2 has kept up with the rise in human CO2 emissions, despite the occurrence of notable interannual and sub-decadal variability, which is predominantly driven by the land's ability to absorb CO2. There is some evidence for a recent increase in airborne fraction, which would imply a faster increase in atmospheric CO2 for a given rate of human fossil-fuel burning.[3] Changes in carbon sinks can affect the airborne fraction as well.   <br><br>Discussion about the trend of airborne fraction[edit]<br>Anthropogenic CO2 that is released into the atmosphere is partitioned into three components: approximately 45% remains in the atmosphere (referred to as the airborne fraction), while about 24% and 31% are absorbed by the oceans (ocean sink) and terrestrial biosphere (land sink), respectively.[4] If the airborne fraction increases, this indicates that a smaller amount of the CO2 released by humans is being absorbed by land and ocean sinks, due to factors such as warming oceans or thawing permafrost. As a result, a greater proportion of anthropogenic emissions remains in the atmosphere, thereby accelerating the rate of climate change. This has implications for future projections of atmospheric CO2 levels, which must be adjusted to account for this trend.[5] The question of whether the airborne fraction is rising, remaining steady at approximately 45%, or declining remains a matter of debate.

> part7 -------------------<br>Solar geoengineering[edit]<br><br>Main article: Stratospheric aerosol injection<br>This graph shows baseline radiative forcing under three different Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios, and how it would be affected by the deployment of SAI, starting from 2034, to either halve the speed of warming by 2100, to halt the warming, or to reverse it entirely.<br>Global dimming is also a relevant phenomenon for certain proposals about slowing, halting or reversing global warming. An increase in planetary albedo of 1% would eliminate most of radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and thereby global warming, while a 2% albedo increase would negate the warming effect of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This is the theory behind solar geoengineering, and the high reflective potential of sulfate aerosols means that they were considered in this capacity for a long time. In 1974, Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, the planet could be cooled by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. This approach would simply send the sulfates to the troposphere – the lowest part of the atmosphere. Using it today would be equivalent to more than reversing the decades of air quality improvements, and the world would face the same issues which prompted the introduction of those regulations in the first place, such as acid rain. The suggestion of relying on tropospheric global dimming to curb warming has been described as a "Faustian bargain" and is not seriously considered by modern research.<br>Instead, starting with the seminal 2006 paper by Paul Crutzen, the solution advocated is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI. It would transport sulfates into the next higher layer of the atmosphere – stratosphere, where they would last for years instead of weeks, so far less sulfur would have to be emitted. It has been estimated that the amount of sulfur needed to offset a warming of around 4 °C (7.2 °F) relative to now (and 5 °C (9.0 °F) relative to the preindustrial), under the highest-emission scenario RCP 8.5 would be less than what is already emitted through air pollution today, and that reductions in sulfur pollution from future air quality improvements already expected under that scenario would offset the sulfur used for geoengineering. The trade-off is increased cost. Although there's a popular narrative that stratospheric aerosol injection can be carried out by individuals, small states, or other non-state rogue actors, scientific estimates suggest that cooling the atmosphere by 1 °C (1.8 °F) through stratospheric aerosol injection would cost at least $18 billion annually (at 2020 USD value), meaning that only the largest economies or economic blocs could afford this intervention. Even so, these approaches would still be "orders of magnitude" cheaper than greenhouse gas mitigation, let alone the costs of unmitigated effects of climate change.<br>The main downside to SAI is that any such cooling would still cease 1–3 years after the last aerosol injection, while the warming from CO2 emissions lasts for hundreds to thousands of years. This means that neither stratospheric aerosol injection nor other forms of solar geoengineering can be used as a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, because if solar geoengineering were to cease while greenhouse gas levels remained high, it would lead to "large and extremely rapid" warming and similarly abrupt changes to the water cycle. Many thousands of species would likely go extinct as the result. Instead, any solar geoengineering would act as a temporary measure to limit warming while emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced and carbon dioxide is removed, which may well take hundreds of years.<br>While stratospheric aerosol injection may temporarily halt or outright reverse the warming, there would still be significant changes in weather patterns in many areas, affecting the ecosystems. Climate change can affect the distribution of infectious diseases, and these changes would also shift the habitat of mosquitoes and other disease vectors, with currently unclear impacts. There have also been early concerns about the impacts on crop yields and carbon sinks, but most recent science suggests that globally, they would be largely unaffected or may even increase slightly relative to the early 21st century. This is because reduced photosynthesis due to lower sunlight would be offset by CO2 fertilization effect and the reduction in thermal stress.
