## Original Question

*My understanding of climate change is that a large increase in human-caused CO2 emissions is likely to lead to large change in the Earth's climate through a global warming effect. Scientific consensus appears to me to be that if we make similarly large reductions in CO2 emissions, we can reduce the magnitude of the consequent warming.

I also understand the climate to have many non-linear mechanisms whereby the link between emission and warming isn't at all straightforward - and so we can only talk about broad averages and so forth, rather than make specific weather predictions.

So is it always true that a reduction in emissions will - on average - cause a reduction in the global warming effect, however small? Or does the existence of tipping points or any other factor mean that only large reductions can make a difference now and any lesser reduction will be pointless?

My intuition says that smaller cuts in emissions should still be preferred to no cuts at all, as I imagine that they would reduce the peak warming and/or delay the peak for longer and/or reduce the eventual recovery time. Perhaps not by as much as we might prefer, but still better than nothing. But perhaps my intuition is off.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're addressing is understanding the impact of reductions in CO2 emissions on global warming, especially considering the complex, non-linear nature of the Earth's climate system. You're asking whether all reductions in CO2 emissions, regardless of their size, contribute to mitigating the global warming effect or if there's a threshold effect that renders small reductions ineffective.

To address this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Scientific Consensus on CO2 Emissions and Global Warming**: There is a broad scientific consensus that human-caused CO2 emissions have significantly contributed to global warming by enhancing the greenhouse effect. This warming effect is primarily due to the ability of CO2 and other greenhouse gases to trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere.

2. **Non-linear Climate Mechanisms**: The Earth's climate system is indeed complex and non-linear, meaning that it does not respond to changes in a simple, directly proportional manner. This complexity arises from various feedback mechanisms, such as the melting of polar ice caps (which reduces the Earth's albedo and leads to further warming) and the release of methane from thawing permafrost.

3. **Tipping Points**: The concept of tipping points in the climate system refers to thresholds beyond which certain changes become irreversible on a practical timescale. Examples include the collapse of major ice sheets or the dieback of significant portions of the Amazon rainforest. Crossing these tipping points could lead to significant and potentially abrupt changes in the climate system.

4. **Impact of Emission Reductions**: Even with the existence of tipping points and non-linear responses, there is no scientific basis for the notion that only large reductions in CO2 emissions can make a difference. On the contrary, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other scientific bodies have emphasized that every reduction in emissions contributes to limiting the magnitude of global warming. This is because the relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and global temperature rise is approximately linear, meaning that for every ton of CO2 emissions avoided, there is a corresponding small reduction in global warming.

5. **Mitigation and Adaptation**: While significant reductions in emissions are necessary to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change, smaller reductions still play a crucial role. They can contribute to delaying the crossing of tipping points, reducing the peak temperature, and providing more time for societies to adapt to changing conditions. Additionally, every bit of warming avoided can help reduce the severity of climate impacts, such as extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and biodiversity loss.

In conclusion, your intuition aligns with scientific understanding: smaller cuts in emissions are indeed preferable to no cuts at all. Every reduction in CO2 emissions contributes to mitigating the global warming effect to some extent. While large-scale reductions are necessary to meet international climate goals and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, smaller reductions also have value in slowing the rate of warming, reducing the peak temperature, and potentially delaying or avoiding some tipping points. The fight against climate change is cumulative, with every action contributing to the broader goal of stabilizing the Earth's climate.

> part3 -------------------<br>Positive feedbacks through the carbon cycle[edit]<br><br>See also: Carbon cycle<br>The global warming projections contained in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) include carbon cycle feedbacks. Authors of AR4, however, noted that scientific understanding of carbon cycle feedbacks was poor. Projections in AR4 were based on a range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and suggested warming between the late 20th and late 21st century of 1.1 to 6.4 °C. This is the "likely" range (greater than 66% probability), based on the expert judgement of the IPCC's authors. Authors noted that the lower end of the "likely" range appeared to be better constrained than the upper end of the "likely" range, in part due to carbon cycle feedbacks. The American Meteorological Society has commented that more research is needed to model the effects of carbon cycle feedbacks in climate change projections.<br>There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming. All 11 models in the C4MIP study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular (HadCM3) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the Amazon Rainforest in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming.<br>Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year).<br>It has also been suggested (by Chris Freeman) that the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat bogs into water courses (from which it would in turn enter the atmosphere) constitutes a positive feedback for global warming. The carbon currently stored in peatlands (390–455 gigatonnes, one-third of the total land-based carbon store) is over half the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere. DOC levels in water courses are observably rising; Freeman's hypothesis is that, not elevated temperatures, but elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are responsible, through stimulation of primary productivity.<br>Tree deaths are believed to be increasing as a result of climate change, which is a positive feedback effect.<br>Methane climate feedbacks in natural ecosystems.<br>Wetlands and freshwater ecosystems are predicted to be the largest potential contributor to a global methane climate feedback. Long-term warming changes the balance in the methane-related microbial community within freshwater ecosystems so they produce more methane while proportionately less is oxidised to carbon dioxide.<br>Arctic methane release[edit]<br>Photo shows what appears to be permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay, Canada, near Greenland. (2008) Global warming will increase permafrost and peatland thaw, which can result in collapse of plateau surfaces.<br><br>Main article: Arctic methane release<br>Warming is also the triggering variable for the release of carbon (potentially as methane) in the arctic. Methane released from thawing permafrost such as the frozen peat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates a positive feedback. In April 2019, Turetsky et al. reported permafrost was thawing quicker than predicted. Recently the understanding of the climate feedback from permafrost improved, but potential emissions from the subsea permafrost remain unknown and are - like many other soil carbon feedbacks - still absent from most climate models.<br>Thawing permafrost[edit]<br><br>See also: Permafrost thaw, Permafrost carbon cycle, and Arctic methane release<br>Western Siberia is the world's largest peat bog, a one million square kilometer region of permafrost peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The thawing of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of methane. As much as 70,000 million tonnes of methane, an extremely effective greenhouse gas, might be released over the next few decades, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar thawing has been observed in eastern Siberia. Lawrence et al. (2008) suggest that a rapid melting of Arctic sea ice may start a feedback loop that rapidly melts Arctic permafrost, triggering further warming. May 31, 2010. NASA published that globally "Greenhouse gases are escaping the permafrost and entering the atmosphere at an increasing rate - up to 50 billion tons each year of methane, for example - due to a global thawing trend. This is particularly troublesome because methane heats the atmosphere with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide" (the equivalent of 1250 billion tons of CO2 per year).<br>Researchers have also analysed how carbon released from permafrost might contribute to global warming. A study from 2011 projected changes in permafrost based on a medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SRES A1B). According to the study, by 2200, the permafrost feedback might contribute 190 (+/- 64) gigatons of carbon cumulatively to the atmosphere.<br>In 2019, a report called " Arctic report card " estimated the current greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic permafrost as almost equal to the emissions of Russia or Japan or less than 10% of the global emissions from fossil fuels.<br>The Sixth IPCC Assessment Report states that "projections from models of permafrost ecosystems suggest that future permafrost thaw will lead to some additional warming – enough to be important, but not enough to lead to a 'runaway warming' situation, where permafrost thaw leads to a dramatic, self-reinforcing acceleration of global warming."<br>Hydrates[edit]<br><br>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis<br>Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the sea and ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a climate tipping event, has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmosphere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and also the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate change event. In 2008, a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed permafrost, around the outfall of the Lena River and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.<br>In 2020, the first leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica was discovered. The scientists are not sure what caused it. The area where it was found had not warmed yet significantly. It is on the side of a volcano, but it seems that it is not from there. The methane-eating microbes consume much less methane than was supposed, and the researchers think this should be included in climate models. They also claim that there is much more to discover about the issue in Antarctica. A quarter of all marine methane is found in the region of Antarctica<br>Abrupt increases in atmospheric methane[edit]<br>Literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) have considered the possibility of future projected climate change leading to a rapid increase in atmospheric methane. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, looked at possible rapid increases in methane due either to reductions in the atmospheric chemical sink or from the release of buried methane reservoirs. In both cases, it was judged that such a release would be "exceptionally unlikely"<br>(less than a 1% chance, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, published in 2008, concluded that an abrupt release of methane into the atmosphere appeared "very unlikely"<br>(less than 10% probability, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, however, noted that climate change would "very likely" (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) accelerate the pace of persistent emissions from both hydrate sources and wetlands.<br>On 10 June 2019 Louise M. Farquharson and her team reported that their 12-year study into Canadian permafrost had "Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090. Between 1990 and 2016, an increase of up to 4 °C has been observed in terrestrial permafrost and this trend is expected to continue as Arctic mean annual air temperatures increase at a rate twice that of lower latitudes." Determining the extent of new thermokarst development is difficult, but there is little doubt the problem is widespread. Farquharson and her team guess that about 231,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers) of permafrost, or about 5.5% of the zone that is permafrost year-round, is vulnerable to rapid surface thawing.<br>Decomposition[edit]<br><br>Main article: Decomposition<br>Organic matter stored in permafrost generates heat as it decomposes in response to the permafrost thawing. The amount of carbon stored in the permafrost region is estimated to be around two times the amount of carbon that is in the Earth's atmosphere. As the tropics get wetter, as many climate models predict, soils are likely to experience greater rates of respiration and decomposition, limiting the carbon storage abilities of tropical soils.<br>Peat decomposition[edit]<br>Peat, occurring naturally in peat bogs, is a store of carbon significant on a global scale. When peat dries it decomposes, and may additionally burn. Water table adjustment due to global warming may cause significant excursions of carbon from peat bogs.  This may be released as methane, which can exacerbate the feedback effect, due to its high global warming potential.<br>Rainforest drying[edit]<br>Rainforests, most notably tropical rainforests, are particularly vulnerable to global warming.  There are a number of effects which may occur, but two are particularly concerning.  Firstly, the drier vegetation may cause total collapse of the rainforest ecosystem.  For example, the Amazon rainforest would tend to be replaced by caatinga ecosystems.  Further, even tropical rainforests ecosystems which do not collapse entirely may lose significant proportions of their stored carbon as a result of drying, due to changes in vegetation.<br>Forest fires[edit]<br><br>See also: Wildfire § Climate change effects, and Effects of climate change on biomes<br>The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predicts that many mid-latitude regions, such as Mediterranean Europe, will experience decreased rainfall and an increased risk of drought, which in turn would allow forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.  Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the Amazon Rainforest, eventually resulting in a transition to Caatinga vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region.<br>Desertification[edit]<br>Desertification is a consequence of global warming in some environments.  Desert soils contain little humus, and support little vegetation.  As a result, transition to desert ecosystems is typically associated with excursions of carbon.

The first involves<br>global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees<br>warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and<br>return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an ‘overshoot’ pathway. Any alternative<br>situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st<br>century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.<br>The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change<br>impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an ‘overshoot’, the<br>greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, on top of reducing<br>the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO2 removal have not been proven to work at scale and,<br>therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that<br>the use of CO2 removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not<br>appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer<br>overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves<br>and accelerated sea level rise.<br>Countries that formally accept or ‘ratify’ the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address<br>climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions<br>(NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all<br>the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to<br>reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the<br>national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and<br>technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to<br>1.5°C at a later date.<br>A world that is consistent with holding warming to 1.5°C would see greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline<br>in the coming decade, with strong international cooperation and a scaling up of countries’ combined ambition<br>beyond current NDCs.

But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes<br>in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could<br>mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use<br>less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater – for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that<br>remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.<br>To stabilize global temperature at any level, ‘net’ CO2 emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the<br>amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between<br>CO2 ‘sources’ and ‘sinks’ is often referred to as ‘net zero’ emissions or ‘carbon neutrality’. The implication of net<br>zero emissions is that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new<br>equilibrium is reached, as CO2 emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and<br>the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries.<br>Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required<br>greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society’s main sectors,<br>including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions<br>that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of<br>energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the ‘carbon footprint’ of the food<br>we consume.<br>The above are examples of ‘supply-side’ actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse<br>gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy<br>human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as ‘demand-side’<br>actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energyand greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand- and<br>supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other. But emphasis can be<br>given to one or the other.<br>Making changes in one sector can have consequences for another, as they are not independent of each other.<br>In other words, the choices that we make now as a society in one sector can either restrict or expand our<br>options later on. For example, a high demand for energy could mean we would need to deploy almost all known<br>options to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with<br>the potential for adverse side-effects. In particular, a pathway with high energy demand would increase our<br>reliance on practices and technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. As of yet, such techniques have<br>not been proven to work on a large scale and, depending on how they are implemented, could compete for land<br>and water.

> part4 -------------------<br>Positive feedbacks through other mechanisms[edit]<br><br>See also: Soil carbon feedback<br>Water vapor feedback[edit]<br><br>Main article: Water vapor feedback<br>If the atmospheres are warmed, the saturation vapor pressure increases, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will tend to increase. Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapor content makes the atmosphere warm further; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapor (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO2 alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture content of the air, the relative humidity stays nearly constant or even decreases slightly because the air is warmer.  Climate models incorporate this feedback. Water vapor feedback is strongly positive, with most evidence supporting a magnitude of 1.5 to 2.0 W/m/K, sufficient  to roughly double the warming that would otherwise occur. Water vapor feedback is considered a faster feedback mechanism.<br>Cloud feedback[edit]<br><br>Main article: Cloud feedback<br>Global warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds. Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a warming effect; seen from above, clouds reflect sunlight and emit infrared radiation to space, and so exert a cooling effect. Whether the net effect is warming or cooling depends on details such as the type and altitude of the cloud. Low clouds are brighter and optically thicker, while high clouds are optically thin (transparent) in the visible and trap IR. Reduction of low clouds tends to increase incoming solar radiation and therefore have a positive feedback, while a reduction in high clouds (since they mostly just trap IR) would result in a negative feedback. These details were poorly observed before the advent of satellite data and are difficult to represent in climate models. Global climate models were showing a near-zero to moderately strong positive net cloud feedback, but the effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in the latest generation of global climate models. Differences in the physical representation of clouds in models drive this enhanced climate sensitivity relative to the previous generation of models.<br>A 2019 simulation predicts that if greenhouse gases reach three times the current level of atmospheric carbon dioxide that stratocumulus clouds could abruptly disperse, contributing to additional global warming.<br>Ice–albedo feedback[edit]<br><br>Main articles: Arctic sea ice decline and Ice–albedo feedback<br>Aerial photograph showing a section of sea ice. The lighter blue areas are melt ponds and the darkest areas are open water; both have a lower albedo than the white sea ice. The melting ice contributes to ice–albedo feedback.<br>When ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less reflective than ice and thus absorb more solar radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more melting, and this cycle continues.  During times of global cooling, additional ice increases the reflectivity, which reduces the absorption of solar radiation, resulting in more cooling through a continuing cycle.  This is considered a faster feedback mechanism.<br>1870–2009 Northern hemisphere sea ice extent in million square kilometers. Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near-constant level extent in Autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation.<br>Albedo change is also the main reason why IPCC predict polar temperatures in the northern hemisphere to rise up to twice as much as those of the rest of the world, in a process known as polar amplification. In September 2007, the Arctic sea ice area reached about half the size of the average summer minimum area between 1979 and 2000. Also in September 2007, Arctic sea ice retreated far enough for the Northwest Passage to become navigable to shipping for the first time in recorded history. The record losses of 2007 and 2008 may, however, be temporary.<br>Mark Serreze of the US National Snow and Ice Data Center views 2030 as a "reasonable estimate" for when the summertime Arctic ice cap might be ice-free. The polar amplification of global warming is not predicted to occur in the southern hemisphere. The Antarctic sea ice reached its greatest extent on record since the beginning of observation in 1979, but the gain in ice in the south is exceeded by the loss in the north. The trend for global sea ice, northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere combined is clearly a decline.<br>Ice loss may have internal feedback processes, as melting of ice over land can cause eustatic sea level rise, potentially causing instability of ice shelves and inundating coastal ice masses, such as glacier tongues.  Further, a potential feedback cycle exists due to earthquakes caused by isostatic rebound further destabilising ice shelves, glaciers and ice caps.<br>The ice–albedo in some sub-arctic forests is also changing, as stands of larch (which shed their needles in winter, allowing sunlight to reflect off the snow in spring and fall) are being replaced by spruce trees (which retain their dark needles all year).<br>Gas release by various sources[edit]<br><br>Main article: Greenhouse gas<br>Release of gases of biological origin may be affected by global warming, but research into such effects is at an early stage.

This amplification of methane warming is due to projected changes in atmospheric chemistry.

> part5 -------------------<br>Relationship to climate change[edit]<br>Past and present[edit]<br>Air pollution, including from large-scale land clearing, has substantially increased the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere when compared to the preindustrial background levels. Different types of particles have different effects, and there is a variety of interactions in different atmospheric layers. Overall, they provide cooling, but complexity makes the exact strength of cooling very difficult to estimate.<br>It has been understood for a long time that any effect on solar irradiance from aerosols would necessarily impact Earth's radiation balance. Reductions in atmospheric temperatures have already been observed after large volcanic eruptions such as the 1963 eruption of Mount Agung in Bali, 1982 El Chichón eruption in Mexico, 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption in Colombia and 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. However, even the major eruptions only result in temporary jumps of sulfur particles, unlike the more sustained increases caused by anthropogenic pollution. In 1990, the IPCC First Assessment Report acknowledged that "Human-made aerosols, from sulphur emitted largely in fossil fuel combustion can modify clouds and this may act to lower temperatures", while "a decrease in emissions of sulphur might be expected to increase global temperatures". However, lack of observational data and difficulties in calculating indirect effects on clouds left the report unable to estimate whether the total impact of all anthropogenic aerosols on the global temperature amounted to cooling or warming. By 1995, the IPCC Second Assessment Report had confidently assessed the overall impact of aerosols as negative (cooling); however, aerosols were recognized as the largest source of uncertainty in future projections in that report and the subsequent ones.<br>At the peak of global dimming, it was able to counteract the warming trend completely, but by 1975, the continually increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases have overcome the masking effect and dominated ever since. Even then, regions with high concentrations of sulfate aerosols due to air pollution had initially experienced cooling, in contradiction to the overall warming trend. The eastern United States was a prominent example: the temperatures there declined by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1970 and 1980, and by up to 1 °C (1.8 °F) in the Arkansas and Missouri. As the sulfate pollution was reduced, the central and eastern United States had experienced warming of 0.3 °C (0.54 °F) between 1980 and 2010, even as sulfate particles still accounted for around 25% of all particulates. By 2021, the northeastern coast of the United States was instead one of the fastest-warming regions of North America, as the slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation increased temperatures in that part of the North Atlantic Ocean.<br>The extent to which physical factors in the atmosphere or on land affect climate change, including the cooling provided by sulfate aerosols and the dimming they cause. The large error bar shows that there are still substantial unresolved uncertainties.<br>Globally, the emergence of extreme heat beyond the preindustrial records was delayed by aerosol cooling, and hot extremes accelerated as global dimming abated: it has been estimated that since the mid-1990s, peak daily temperatures in northeast Asia and hottest days of the year in Western Europe would have been substantially less hot if aerosol concentrations had stayed the same as before. In Europe, the declines in aerosol concentrations since the 1980s had also reduced the associated fog, mist and haze: altogether, it was responsible for about 10–20% of daytime warming across Europe, and about 50% of the warming over the more polluted Eastern Europe. Because aerosol cooling depends on reflecting sunlight, air quality improvements had a negligible impact on wintertime temperatures, but had increased temperatures from April to September by around 1 °C (1.8 °F) in Central and Eastern Europe. Some of the acceleration of sea level rise, as well as Arctic amplification and the associated Arctic sea ice decline, was also attributed to the reduction in aerosol masking.<br>In addition to revealing the limited effect of contrails, COVID-19 lockdowns provided another "natural experiment", as there had been a marked decline in sulfate emissions caused by the curtailed road traffic and industrial output. That decline did have a detectable warming impact: it was estimated to have increased global temperatures by 0.01–0.02 °C (0.018–0.036 °F) initially and up to 0.03 °C (0.054 °F) by 2023, before disappearing. Regionally, the lockdowns were estimated to increase temperatures by 0.05–0.15 °C (0.090–0.270 °F) in eastern China over January–March, and then by 0.04–0.07 °C (0.072–0.126 °F) over Europe, eastern United States, and South Asia in March–May, with the peak impact of 0.3 °C (0.54 °F) in some regions of the United States and Russia. In the city of Wuhan, the urban heat island effect was found to have decreased by 0.24 °C (0.43 °F) at night and by 0.12 °C (0.22 °F) overall during the strictest lockdowns.<br>Pollution from black carbon, mostly represented by soot, also contributes to global dimming. However, because it absorbs heat instead of reflecting it, it warms the planet instead of cooling it like sulfates. This warming is much weaker than that of greenhouse gases, but it can be regionally significant when black carbon is deposited over ice masses like mountain glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet, where it reduces their albedo and increases their absorption of solar radiation. Even the indirect effect of soot particles acting as cloud nuclei is not strong enough to provide cooling: the "brown clouds" formed around soot particles were known to have a net warming effect since the 2000s. Black carbon pollution is particularly strong over India, and as the result, it is considered to be one of the few regions where cleaning up air pollution would reduce, rather than increase, warming.<br>Future[edit]<br>Early 2010s estimates of past and future anthropogenic global sulfur dioxide emissions, including the Representative Concentration Pathways. While no climate change scenario may reach Maximum Feasible Reductions (MFRs), all assume steep declines from today's levels. By 2019, sulfate emission reductions were confirmed to proceed at a very fast rate.<br>Since changes in aerosol concentrations already have an impact on the global climate, they would necessarily influence future projections as well. In fact, it is impossible to fully estimate the warming impact of all greenhouse gases without accounting for the counteracting cooling from aerosols. Climate models started to account for the effects of sulfate aerosols around the IPCC Second Assessment Report; when the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report was published in 2007, every climate model had integrated sulfates, but only 5 were able to account for less impactful particulates like black carbon. By 2021, CMIP6 models estimated total aerosol cooling in the range from 0.1 °C (0.18 °F) to 0.7 °C (1.3 °F); The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report selected the best estimate of a 0.5 °C (0.90 °F) cooling provided by sulfate aerosols, while black carbon amounts to about 0.1 °C (0.18 °F) of warming. While these values are based on combining model estimates with observational constraints, including those on ocean heat content, the matter is not yet fully settled. The difference between model estimates mainly stems from disagreements over the indirect effects of aerosols on clouds.<br>Regardless of the current strength of aerosol cooling, all future climate change scenarios project decreases in particulates and this includes the scenarios where 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) and 2 °C (3.6 °F) targets are met: their specific emission reduction targets assume the need to make up for lower dimming. Since models estimate that the cooling caused by sulfates is largely equivalent to the warming caused by atmospheric methane (and since methane is a relatively short-lived greenhouse gas), it is believed that simultaneous reductions in both would effectively cancel each other out. Yet, in the recent years, methane concentrations had been increasing at rates exceeding their previous period of peak growth in the 1980s, with wetland methane emissions driving much of the recent growth, while air pollution is getting cleaned up aggressively. These trends are some of the main reasons why 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) warming is now expected around 2030, as opposed to the mid-2010s estimates where it would not occur until 2040.<br>Between 1980s and 2010s, the reduction in aerosol density over Europe had lowered the difference between thermal energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and between thermal energy radiating off the ground (top left, blue), which increased the net amount of heating and contributed to increase in extreme temperatures (other images, red).<br>It has also been suggested that aerosols are not given sufficient attention in regional risk assessments, in spite of being more influential on a regional scale than globally. For instance, a climate change scenario with high greenhouse gas emissions but strong reductions in air pollution would see 0.2 °C (0.36 °F)  more global warming by 2050 than the same scenario with little improvement in air quality, but regionally, the difference would add 5 more tropical nights per year in northern China and substantially increase precipitation in northern China and northern India. Likewise, a paper comparing current level of clean air policies with a hypothetical maximum technically feasible action under otherwise the same climate change scenario found that the latter would increase the risk of temperature extremes by 30–50% in China and in Europe. Unfortunately, because historical records of aerosols are sparser in some regions than in others, accurate regional projections of aerosol impacts are difficult. Even the latest CMIP6 climate models can only accurately represent aerosol trends over Europe, but struggle with representing North America and Asia, meaning that their near-future projections of regional impacts are likely to contain errors as well.

It examines the "maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level".[2]: 2220  It can be expressed relative to the pre-industrial period (the year 1750). In this case, it is the total carbon budget. Or it can be expressed from a recent specified date onwards. In that case it is the remaining carbon budget.[2]: 2220 <br>A carbon budget that will keeping global warming below a specified temperature limit is also called an emissions budget or quota, or allowable emissions.[3][4][5] Apart from limiting the global temperature increase, another objective of such an emissions budget can be to limit sea level rise.[6]<br>Scientists combine estimates of various contributing factors to calculate the carbon budget. The estimates take into account the available scientific evidence as well as value judgments or choices.[7][8][9][10][11]<br>Global carbon budgets can be further sub-divided into national emissions budgets. This can help countries set their own emission goals. Emissions budgets indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. The change in global temperature is independent of the source of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.[12][13]<br>To translate global carbon budgets to the country level, a set of value judgments have to be made on how to distribute the remaining carbon budget over all the different countries. This should take into account aspects of equity and fairness between countries[10][14] as well as other methodological choices.[14] There are many differences between nations, such as population size, level of industrialisation, historic emissions, and mitigation capabilities. For this reason, scientists are attempting to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using various principles of equity.[15]<br><br><br>Definition[edit]<br>The IPCC Sixth Assessment Reports defines carbon budget as the following two concepts:[2]: 2220 <br><br>"An assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, emissions and removals associated with land use and land-use change, ocean and natural land sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is referred to as the global carbon budget."; or<br>"The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date."<br>Global carbon budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals.<br>An emissions budget may be distinguished from an emissions target, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature and are commonly applied to the annual emissions in a single year as well.<br><br>Estimations[edit]<br>See also: Carbon monitoring<br>Recent and currently remaining carbon budget[edit]<br>Historical (unrestrained) carbon budget: Cumulative contributions to the global carbon budget since 1850 illustrate how source and sink components have been out of balance, causing an approximately 50% rise in atmospheric CO2.[16]Fossil CO2 emissions: global; territorial; by fuel type (incl cement); per capita[17]<br>Several organisations provide annual updates to the remaining carbon budget, including the Global Carbon Project, the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)[18] and the CONSTRAIN project.[19] In March 2022, before formal publication of the "Global Carbon Budget 2021" preprint,[17] scientists reported, based on Carbon Monitor[20] (CM) data, that after COVID-19-pandemic-caused record-level declines in 2020, global CO2 emissions rebounded sharply by 4.8% in 2021, indicating that at the current trajectory, the carbon budget for a ⅔ likelihood for limiting warming to 1.5 °C would be used up within 9.5 years.[21]<br>In April 2022, the now reviewed and officially published The Global Carbon Budget 2021 concluded that fossil CO2 emissions rebounded[22] from pandemic levels by around +4.8% relative to 2020 emissions – returning to 2019 levels.<br>It identifies three major issues for improving reliable accuracy of monitoring, shows that China and India surpassed 2019 levels (by 5.7% and 3.2%) while the EU and the US stayed beneath 2019 levels (by 5.3% and 4.5%), quantifies various changes and trends, for the first time provides models' estimates that are linked to the official country GHG inventories reporting, and suggests that the remaining carbon budget at 1. Jan 2022 for a 50% likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5 °C (albeit a temporary exceedence is to be expected) is 120 GtC (420 GtCO2) – or 11 years of 2021 emissions levels.[17]<br>This does not mean that likely 11 years remain to cut emissions but that if emissions stayed the same, instead of increasing like in 2021, 11 years of constant GHG emissions would be left in the hypothetical scenario that all emissions suddenly ceased in the 12th year. (The 50% likelihood may be describable as a kind of minimum plausible deniability requirement as lower likelihoods would make the 1.5 °C goal "unlikely".) Moreover, other trackers show (or highlight) different amounts of carbon budget left, such as the MCC, which as of May 2022 shows "7 years 1 month left"[18] and different likelihoods have different carbon budgets: a 83% likelihood would mean 6.6 ±0.1 years left (ending in 2028) according to CM data.[21]<br>In October 2023 a group of researchers updated the carbon budget including the CO2 emitted at 2020-2022 and new findings about the role of reduced presence of polluting particles in the atmosphere.[23] They found we can emit 250 GtCO2 or 6 years of emissions at current level starting from January 2023, for having a 50% chance to stay below 1.5 degrees. For reaching this target humanity will need to zero CO2 emissions by the year 2034. To have a 50% chance of staying below 2 degrees humanity can emit 1220 GtCO2 or 30 years of emissions at current level.[24][25]<br><br>Carbon budget in gigatonnes and factors[edit]<br>Estimating the remaining carbon budget at the global level depends on climate science and value judgments or choices. To translate a global budget to the national level, further value judgments and choices have to be made.[7]<br>The finding of an almost linear relationship between global temperature rise and cumulative carbon dioxide emissions[13] has encouraged the estimation of global emissions budgets in order to remain below dangerous levels of warming. Since the pre-industrial period (year 1750) to 2019, approximately 2390 Gigatonnes of CO2 (Gt CO2) has already been emitted globally.[11]<br>Scientific estimations of the remaining global emissions budgets/quotas differ due to varied methodological approaches, and considerations of thresholds.[26] Estimations might not include all amplifying climate change feedbacks,[27][28][29][30] although the most authoritative carbon budget assessments as summarised by the IPCC do account explicitly for these.[8][11] Scientists assess the size of remaining carbon budgets using estimates of:<br><br>past warming caused by human activities,<br>the amount of warming per cumulative unit of CO2 emissions (also known as the Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions of carbon dioxide, or TCRE),<br>the amount of warming that could still occur once all emissions of CO2 are halted (known as the Zero Emissions Commitment[31]), and<br>the impact of Earth system feedbacks that would otherwise not be covered.<br>The estimates vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs).[8][9][11][32] This approach was first applied in the 2018 Special report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C by the IPCC,[8] and was also used in its 2021 Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report.[11]<br>Carbon budget estimates depend on the likelihood or probability of avoiding a temperature limit, and the assumed warming that is projected to be caused by non-CO2 emissions.[8][9][11][33] These estimates assume non-CO2 emissions are also reduced in line with deep decarbonisation scenarios that reach global net zero CO2 emissions.[8][9][11] Carbon budget estimates thus depend on how successful society is in reducing non-CO2 emissions together with carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists estimated that remaining carbon budgets can be 220 Gt CO2 higher or lower depending on how successful non-CO2 emissions are reduced.[11]<br><br><br><br>Estimated carbon budgets in GtCO2 from 2020 with likelihoods[11]: Table 5.8 <br><br><br>Global warming relative to 1850-1900<br><br>17%<br><br>33%<br><br>50%<br><br>66%<br><br>83%<br><br><br>1.5 °C<br><br>900<br>650<br>500<br>400<br>300<br><br><br>1.7 °C<br><br>1450<br>1050<br>850<br>700<br>550<br><br><br>2.0 °C<br><br>2300<br>1700<br>1350<br>1150<br>900<br><br>National emissions budgets[edit]<br>See also: Nationally determined contribution<br>Carbon budgets are applicable to the global level. To translate these global carbon budgets to the country level, a set of value judgments have to be made on how to distribute the total and remaining carbon budget. In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialisation, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.[15] Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the effort to reduce global emissions, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets,[5][34][35][36][37] often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations.<br>One guiding principle that is used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" that is included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[15] This principle is not defined in further detail in the UNFCCC but is broadly understood to recognize nations' different cumulative historical contributions to global emissions as well as their different development stages. From this perspective, those countries with greater emissions during a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) are the most responsible for addressing excess emissions, as are countries that are richer. Thus, their national emissions budgets have to be smaller than those from countries that have polluted less in the past, or are poorer. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s[38][39] and has been part of the key international agreements on climate change (UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement). Consequently, those countries with the highest cumulative historical emissions have the most responsibility to take the strongest actions[40] and help developing countries to mitigate their emissions and adapt to climate change. This principle is recognized in international treaties and has been part of the diplomatic strategies by developing countries, that argue that they need larger emissions budgets[41] to reduce inequity and achieve sustainable development.<br>Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "egalitarian" principle. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.[15] Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.[34][35][36][42] This principle may be favoured by nations with larger or rapidly growing populations,[41] but raises the question whether individuals can have a right to pollute.[43]<br>A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national sovereignty.[15] The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.[15] The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,[42] and has been used under international regimes such as the Kyoto Protocol[44] and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)[45] This principle is often favoured by developed countries, as it allocates larger emissions budgets to them.[41] However, recent publications highlight that grandfathering is unsupported as an equity principle as it "creates 'cascading biases' against poorer states,[46] is not a 'standard of equity'[47]".[48] Other scholars have highlighted that "to treat states as the owners of emission rights has morally problematic consequences".[43]<br><br>Pathways to stay within carbon budget[edit]<br>The steps that can be taken to stay within one's carbon budget are explained within the concept of climate change mitigation.<br><br>This section is an excerpt from Climate change mitigation.[edit]<br>Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily caused by people burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Phasing out fossil fuel use can happen by conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar, and nuclear power. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Governments have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but actions to date are insufficient to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.[49]<br>Solar energy and wind power have the greatest potential for supplanting fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other options.[50] The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid ugrades, such as using long-distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources.[51] Energy storage can also be used to even out power output, and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low. Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology have not yet proven economical.[52]<br>Human land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation cause about 1/4th of climate change. These changes impact how much CO2 is absorbed by plant matter and how much organic matter decays or burns to release CO2. These changes are part of the fast carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that was buried underground as part of the slow carbon cycle. Methane is a short lived greenhouse gas that is produced by decaying organic matter and livestock, as well as fossil fuel extraction. Land use changes can also impact precipitation patterns and the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet (also referred to as low-carbon diet), and by improving farming processes.[53]<br><br>Various policies can encourage climate change mitigation. Carbon pricing systems have been set up that either tax CO2 emissions or cap total emissions and trade emission credits. Fossil fuel subsidies can be eliminated in favor of clean energy subsidies, and incentives offered for installing energy efficiency measures or switching to electric power sources.[54] Another issue is overcoming environmental objections when constructing new clean energy sources and making grid modifications. Current policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100.[55] This warming is significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and preferably to 1.5 °C.[56][57]<br>See also[edit]<br>Global Carbon Project<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ Christiana Figueres; Hans Joachim Schellnhuber; Gail Whiteman; Johan Rockström (2017-06-29).

With just one click, you can compare the estimates for both temperature targets and see how much time is left in each scenario.<br><br><br><br> As to the scientific basis of the Carbon Clock, we exclusively draw on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which represents the verified state of research. The IPCC last updated its estimate of the remaining carbon budget in summer 2021, with the presentation of the first part of its Sixth Assessment Report.   According to report (see here, table SPM.2), on the 1.5 degree Celsius target, the atmosphere can absorb, calculated from the beginning of 2020, no more than 400 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 if we are to stay below the 1.5°C threshold. Annual emissions of CO2 – from burning fossil fuels, industrial processes and land-use change – are estimated to be 42.2 Gt per year, the equivalent of 1,337 tonnes per second. With emissions at a constant level, the budget would be expected to be used up in less than six years from now. The budget for staying below the 2°C threshold, for its part, of 1,150 Gt, would be exhausted in about 23 years. The budgets are calculated in such a way that it is highly likely that the respective temperature target will be met, that is in two thirds of the climate scenarios examined.Thus, the clock is ticking, showing how little time is left for political decision-makers to take action. Navigating the MCC website allows for an interactive understanding of the time frame of action required for a given political goal: with just one click, the upper left-hand corner leads you to the scenario for the 2°C target, and the upper right-hand corner to the 1.5°C target. In both cases, the clock shows the remaining carbon budget – and the remaining time. MCC's Carbon Clock only reflects the remaining budget for CO2; the contribution of other greenhouse gases to global heating is subtracted before calculating this remaining carbon budget (for more details see here, top of third page).The concept of the carbon budget is based on a almost linear relationship between the cumulative emissions and the temperature rise. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the earth would necessarily be 1.5⁰C warmer at the very point in time when the remaining carbon budget for staying below the 1.5⁰C threshold was used up. This is due to, among others, the fact that there is a time lag between the concentration of emissions in the atmosphere and the impact thereof on the temperature.   While the Carbon Clock appears to be a precise measurement of the time left to ensure climate protection, many uncertainty factors remain, such as different definitions of the 1.5°C target as well as different assumptions about the climate sensitivity, the actually attained degree of global warming, and the future development of other greenhouse gases. Furthermore, for the time being, the calculation is based on the assumption that annual emissions, after a dip in the pandemic year of 2020, will remain at the 2019 level from 2021 onwards.In an interview with the Zurich weekly WOZ (in German), whch was published in 2018, the former MCC Secretary General Brigitte Knopf has explained in detail how the Carbon Clock illustrates climate change and indicates the urgency of political action.For questions about the Carbon Clock, please contact MCC Press and Public Relations.   Further information:By using the following line of HTML code line, you can embed the MCC Carbon Clock into your website: 	<iframe src="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/fileadmin/data/clock/carbon_clock.htm?i=3267263" style="width:600px; height:340px;"</iframeYou can use the following link to drag the MCC Carbon Clock onto the entire screen of your device:https://www.mcc-berlin.net/fileadmin/data/clock/carbon_clock.htmInformation on the latest update of the Carbon Clock in summer 2021 as a result of new IPCC figures can be found here. <br><br><br><br><br>                Remaining carbon budget

It examines the "maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level".[2]: 2220  It can be expressed relative to the pre-industrial period (the year 1750). In this case, it is the total carbon budget. Or it can be expressed from a recent specified date onwards. In that case it is the remaining carbon budget.[2]: 2220 <br>A carbon budget that will keeping global warming below a specified temperature limit is also called an emissions budget or quota, or allowable emissions.[3][4][5] Apart from limiting the global temperature increase, another objective of such an emissions budget can be to limit sea level rise.[6]<br>Scientists combine estimates of various contributing factors to calculate the carbon budget. The estimates take into account the available scientific evidence as well as value judgments or choices.[7][8][9][10][11]<br>Global carbon budgets can be further sub-divided into national emissions budgets. This can help countries set their own emission goals. Emissions budgets indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. The change in global temperature is independent of the source of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.[12][13]<br>To translate global carbon budgets to the country level, a set of value judgments have to be made on how to distribute the remaining carbon budget over all the different countries. This should take into account aspects of equity and fairness between countries[10][14] as well as other methodological choices.[14] There are many differences between nations, such as population size, level of industrialisation, historic emissions, and mitigation capabilities. For this reason, scientists are attempting to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using various principles of equity.[15]<br><br><br>Definition[edit]<br>The IPCC Sixth Assessment Reports defines carbon budget as the following two concepts:[2]: 2220 <br><br>"An assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil fuel and cement emissions, emissions and removals associated with land use and land-use change, ocean and natural land sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the resulting change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This is referred to as the global carbon budget."; or<br>"The maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date."<br>Global carbon budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals.<br>An emissions budget may be distinguished from an emissions target, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature and are commonly applied to the annual emissions in a single year as well.<br><br>Estimations[edit]<br>See also: Carbon monitoring<br>Recent and currently remaining carbon budget[edit]<br>Historical (unrestrained) carbon budget: Cumulative contributions to the global carbon budget since 1850 illustrate how source and sink components have been out of balance, causing an approximately 50% rise in atmospheric CO2.[16]Fossil CO2 emissions: global; territorial; by fuel type (incl cement); per capita[17]<br>Several organisations provide annual updates to the remaining carbon budget, including the Global Carbon Project, the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)[18] and the CONSTRAIN project.[19] In March 2022, before formal publication of the "Global Carbon Budget 2021" preprint,[17] scientists reported, based on Carbon Monitor[20] (CM) data, that after COVID-19-pandemic-caused record-level declines in 2020, global CO2 emissions rebounded sharply by 4.8% in 2021, indicating that at the current trajectory, the carbon budget for a ⅔ likelihood for limiting warming to 1.5 °C would be used up within 9.5 years.[21]<br>In April 2022, the now reviewed and officially published The Global Carbon Budget 2021 concluded that fossil CO2 emissions rebounded[22] from pandemic levels by around +4.8% relative to 2020 emissions – returning to 2019 levels.<br>It identifies three major issues for improving reliable accuracy of monitoring, shows that China and India surpassed 2019 levels (by 5.7% and 3.2%) while the EU and the US stayed beneath 2019 levels (by 5.3% and 4.5%), quantifies various changes and trends, for the first time provides models' estimates that are linked to the official country GHG inventories reporting, and suggests that the remaining carbon budget at 1. Jan 2022 for a 50% likelihood to limit global warming to 1.5 °C (albeit a temporary exceedence is to be expected) is 120 GtC (420 GtCO2) – or 11 years of 2021 emissions levels.[17]<br>This does not mean that likely 11 years remain to cut emissions but that if emissions stayed the same, instead of increasing like in 2021, 11 years of constant GHG emissions would be left in the hypothetical scenario that all emissions suddenly ceased in the 12th year. (The 50% likelihood may be describable as a kind of minimum plausible deniability requirement as lower likelihoods would make the 1.5 °C goal "unlikely".) Moreover, other trackers show (or highlight) different amounts of carbon budget left, such as the MCC, which as of May 2022 shows "7 years 1 month left"[18] and different likelihoods have different carbon budgets: a 83% likelihood would mean 6.6 ±0.1 years left (ending in 2028) according to CM data.[21]<br>In October 2023 a group of researchers updated the carbon budget including the CO2 emitted at 2020-2022 and new findings about the role of reduced presence of polluting particles in the atmosphere.[23] They found we can emit 250 GtCO2 or 6 years of emissions at current level starting from January 2023, for having a 50% chance to stay below 1.5 degrees. For reaching this target humanity will need to zero CO2 emissions by the year 2034. To have a 50% chance of staying below 2 degrees humanity can emit 1220 GtCO2 or 30 years of emissions at current level.[24][25]<br><br>Carbon budget in gigatonnes and factors[edit]<br>Estimating the remaining carbon budget at the global level depends on climate science and value judgments or choices. To translate a global budget to the national level, further value judgments and choices have to be made.[7]<br>The finding of an almost linear relationship between global temperature rise and cumulative carbon dioxide emissions[13] has encouraged the estimation of global emissions budgets in order to remain below dangerous levels of warming. Since the pre-industrial period (year 1750) to 2019, approximately 2390 Gigatonnes of CO2 (Gt CO2) has already been emitted globally.[11]<br>Scientific estimations of the remaining global emissions budgets/quotas differ due to varied methodological approaches, and considerations of thresholds.[26] Estimations might not include all amplifying climate change feedbacks,[27][28][29][30] although the most authoritative carbon budget assessments as summarised by the IPCC do account explicitly for these.[8][11] Scientists assess the size of remaining carbon budgets using estimates of:<br><br>past warming caused by human activities,<br>the amount of warming per cumulative unit of CO2 emissions (also known as the Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions of carbon dioxide, or TCRE),<br>the amount of warming that could still occur once all emissions of CO2 are halted (known as the Zero Emissions Commitment[31]), and<br>the impact of Earth system feedbacks that would otherwise not be covered.<br>The estimates vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs).[8][9][11][32] This approach was first applied in the 2018 Special report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C by the IPCC,[8] and was also used in its 2021 Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report.[11]<br>Carbon budget estimates depend on the likelihood or probability of avoiding a temperature limit, and the assumed warming that is projected to be caused by non-CO2 emissions.[8][9][11][33] These estimates assume non-CO2 emissions are also reduced in line with deep decarbonisation scenarios that reach global net zero CO2 emissions.[8][9][11] Carbon budget estimates thus depend on how successful society is in reducing non-CO2 emissions together with carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists estimated that remaining carbon budgets can be 220 Gt CO2 higher or lower depending on how successful non-CO2 emissions are reduced.[11]<br><br><br><br>Estimated carbon budgets in GtCO2 from 2020 with likelihoods[11]: Table 5.8 <br><br><br>Global warming relative to 1850-1900<br><br>17%<br><br>33%<br><br>50%<br><br>66%<br><br>83%<br><br><br>1.5 °C<br><br>900<br>650<br>500<br>400<br>300<br><br><br>1.7 °C<br><br>1450<br>1050<br>850<br>700<br>550<br><br><br>2.0 °C<br><br>2300<br>1700<br>1350<br>1150<br>900<br><br>National emissions budgets[edit]<br>See also: Nationally determined contribution<br>Carbon budgets are applicable to the global level. To translate these global carbon budgets to the country level, a set of value judgments have to be made on how to distribute the total and remaining carbon budget. In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialisation, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.[15] Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the effort to reduce global emissions, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets,[5][34][35][36][37] often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations.<br>One guiding principle that is used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" that is included in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).[15] This principle is not defined in further detail in the UNFCCC but is broadly understood to recognize nations' different cumulative historical contributions to global emissions as well as their different development stages. From this perspective, those countries with greater emissions during a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) are the most responsible for addressing excess emissions, as are countries that are richer. Thus, their national emissions budgets have to be smaller than those from countries that have polluted less in the past, or are poorer. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s[38][39] and has been part of the key international agreements on climate change (UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement). Consequently, those countries with the highest cumulative historical emissions have the most responsibility to take the strongest actions[40] and help developing countries to mitigate their emissions and adapt to climate change. This principle is recognized in international treaties and has been part of the diplomatic strategies by developing countries, that argue that they need larger emissions budgets[41] to reduce inequity and achieve sustainable development.<br>Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "egalitarian" principle. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.[15] Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.[34][35][36][42] This principle may be favoured by nations with larger or rapidly growing populations,[41] but raises the question whether individuals can have a right to pollute.[43]<br>A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national sovereignty.[15] The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.[15] The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,[42] and has been used under international regimes such as the Kyoto Protocol[44] and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)[45] This principle is often favoured by developed countries, as it allocates larger emissions budgets to them.[41] However, recent publications highlight that grandfathering is unsupported as an equity principle as it "creates 'cascading biases' against poorer states,[46] is not a 'standard of equity'[47]".[48] Other scholars have highlighted that "to treat states as the owners of emission rights has morally problematic consequences".[43]<br><br>Pathways to stay within carbon budget[edit]<br>The steps that can be taken to stay within one's carbon budget are explained within the concept of climate change mitigation.<br><br>This section is an excerpt from Climate change mitigation.[edit]<br>Climate change mitigation (or decarbonisation) is action to limit the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that cause climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily caused by people burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Phasing out fossil fuel use can happen by conserving energy and replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources such as wind, hydro, solar, and nuclear power. Secondary mitigation strategies include changes to land use and removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Governments have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but actions to date are insufficient to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.[49]<br>Solar energy and wind power have the greatest potential for supplanting fossil fuels at the lowest cost compared to other options.[50] The availability of sunshine and wind is variable and can require electrical grid ugrades, such as using long-distance electricity transmission to group a range of power sources.[51] Energy storage can also be used to even out power output, and demand management can limit power use when power generation is low. Cleanly generated electricity can usually replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Certain processes are more difficult to decarbonise, such as air travel and cement production. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be an option to reduce net emissions in these circumstances, although fossil fuel power plants with CCS technology have not yet proven economical.[52]<br>Human land use changes such as agriculture and deforestation cause about 1/4th of climate change. These changes impact how much CO2 is absorbed by plant matter and how much organic matter decays or burns to release CO2. These changes are part of the fast carbon cycle, whereas fossil fuels release CO2 that was buried underground as part of the slow carbon cycle. Methane is a short lived greenhouse gas that is produced by decaying organic matter and livestock, as well as fossil fuel extraction. Land use changes can also impact precipitation patterns and the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth. It is possible to cut emissions from agriculture by reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet (also referred to as low-carbon diet), and by improving farming processes.[53]<br><br>Various policies can encourage climate change mitigation. Carbon pricing systems have been set up that either tax CO2 emissions or cap total emissions and trade emission credits. Fossil fuel subsidies can be eliminated in favor of clean energy subsidies, and incentives offered for installing energy efficiency measures or switching to electric power sources.[54] Another issue is overcoming environmental objections when constructing new clean energy sources and making grid modifications. Current policies are insufficient as they would still result in global warming of about 2.7 °C by 2100.[55] This warming is significantly above the 2015 Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and preferably to 1.5 °C.[56][57]<br>See also[edit]<br>Global Carbon Project<br>References[edit]<br><br><br>^ Christiana Figueres; Hans Joachim Schellnhuber; Gail Whiteman; Johan Rockström (2017-06-29).
