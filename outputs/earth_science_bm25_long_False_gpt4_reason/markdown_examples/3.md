# Query `3`

## Original Question

*I have never understood why earth's inner core is solid. Considering that the inner core is made of an iron-nickel alloy (melting point around 1350 C to 1600 C) and the temperature of the inner core is approximately 5430 C (about the temperature of the surface of the sun). Since Earth's core is nearly 3-4 times the melting point of iron-nickel alloys how can it possibly be solid?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why Earth's inner core remains solid despite its temperature being significantly higher than the melting point of iron-nickel alloys, which are believed to primarily compose the core.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding States of Matter**: The state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a substance under various conditions is determined not just by temperature but also by pressure. At Earth's surface, we're accustomed to water freezing at 0°C and iron melting at around 1538°C. However, these points change under different pressures.

2. **Pressure at Earth's Core**: The Earth's inner core is under immense pressure due to the weight of the overlying Earth. This pressure is estimated to be in the range of 330 to 360 gigapascals (over 3 million times the atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface). High pressure increases the melting point of materials.

3. **Iron-Nickel Alloy under High Pressure**: While the iron-nickel alloy has a melting point of around 1350°C to 1600°C at surface pressure, under the extreme pressures found at the core, its melting point is significantly raised. This means that, despite the high temperatures, the conditions still favor a solid state over a liquid one.

4. **Comparative Planetary Science**: It's worth noting that the behavior of materials under such extreme conditions can also be inferred from theoretical models and experimental physics, where materials are subjected to high pressures and temperatures to simulate conditions similar to those in Earth's core.

5. **Seismic Wave Studies**: Evidence for the solid nature of the inner core comes from seismic wave studies. When earthquakes occur, they generate seismic waves that travel through the Earth. The way these waves are reflected and refracted gives us clues about the composition and state of the Earth's interior. Observations have shown that P-waves (primary waves, which can travel through both liquid and solid) pass through the inner core, while S-waves (secondary waves, which can only travel through solids) are only transmitted through the inner core, indicating it is in a solid state.

### Conclusion:

Despite the high temperatures in Earth's inner core, which far exceed the melting point of iron-nickel alloys at surface pressure, the extreme pressure at the core significantly raises the melting point of these materials, keeping the inner core in a solid state. This is supported by seismic data and aligns with our understanding of physical laws regarding pressure, temperature, and state of matter. This interplay of extreme conditions is a fascinating aspect of Earth's geology, showcasing the complex and dynamic nature of our planet's interior.

> radius.<br>The inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally composed primarily of iron and some nickel. Since this layer is able to transmit shear waves (transverse seismic waves), it must be solid. Experimental evidence has at times been inconsistent with current crystal models of the core. Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000 K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies. The laser studies create plasma, and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will

The solid green line shows the behaviour of the melting point for most substances; the dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water.  The red lines show the sublimation temperature and the blue line the boiling point, showing how they vary with pressure.<br>The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as water. The axes correspond to the pressure and temperature. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of solid, liquid, and gas.<br>The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point.  The open spaces, where the free energy is analytic, correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where phase transitions occur, which are called phase boundaries.<br>In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the critical point. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable, in what is known as a supercritical fluid. In water, the critical point occurs at around Tc = 647.096 K (373.946 °C), pc = 22.064 MPa (217.75 atm) and ρc = 356 kg/m.<br>The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same symmetry group.<br>For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive slope so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is denser than the liquid phase. The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's intermolecular forces. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.<br>Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of hydrogen bonding which requires a greater separation of water molecules. Other exceptions include antimony and bismuth.<br>At very high pressures above 50 GPa (500 000 atm), liquid nitrogen undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition to a polymeric form and becomes denser than solid nitrogen at the same pressure.

For most substances ΔVfus is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ΔVfus is negative so that the slope is negative.<br>Other thermodynamic properties[edit]<br>In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams.  Examples of such thermodynamic properties include specific volume, specific enthalpy, or specific entropy.
