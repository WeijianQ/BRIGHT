## Original Question

*Methane clathrates are

solid clathrate compound (more specifically, a clathrate hydrate) in which a large amount of methane is trapped within a crystal structure of water, forming a solid similar to ice.

They mostly are on the bottom of the world's oceans; however, the overly brief wikipedia section for continental deposits suggests that it also occurs in Siberia, northern Canada and Alaska.

How much methane clathrates are believed to be buried in these continental deposits?*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is determining the quantity of methane clathrates buried in continental deposits, specifically in regions such as Siberia, northern Canada, and Alaska. Methane clathrates, being solid structures where methane is trapped within a water crystal framework, represent a significant source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Understanding the amount of methane clathrates in these areas is crucial for both climate science and potential energy resources. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Methane Clathrates**: First, it's important to grasp what methane clathrates are and why their quantity matters. Methane clathrates can potentially release large amounts of methane into the atmosphere if destabilized, influencing climate change. Conversely, they also represent a vast, untapped energy source.

2. **Identifying Key Areas**: The focus is on continental deposits, particularly in cold regions such as Siberia, northern Canada, and Alaska. These areas are significant because the conditions allow for the formation and storage of methane clathrates beneath the permafrost or within sediments.

3. **Estimation Challenges**: Estimating the amount of methane clathrates in these regions is challenging due to the lack of direct measurements, the difficulty of accessing these deposits, and the variability in depth and concentration of clathrates.

4. **Research and Studies**: To address the question, we would look at scientific research, surveys, and studies that have attempted to estimate the volume of methane clathrates in these continental deposits. This could involve geophysical surveys, drilling projects, and modeling studies.

5. **Current Estimates**: While specific numbers may vary, it's essential to compile and compare findings from multiple sources to get a range or consensus on the estimated quantities. Previous estimates have suggested that globally, methane clathrates could contain anywhere from 1 to 5 trillion tons of carbon. However, breaking this down to specific continental regions requires more detailed analysis.

6. **Potential for Variability**: Recognize that estimates can vary widely based on the methodology used, the area covered by studies, and assumptions about the concentration and distribution of clathrates. 

### Draft Answer

Determining the exact quantity of methane clathrates buried in continental deposits in Siberia, northern Canada, and Alaska is a complex task due to the challenges in direct measurement and the variability of deposits. Research in this area involves geophysical surveys and drilling studies, aiming to estimate the volume of these clathrates. While global estimates of methane clathrates suggest a significant amount of carbon trapped in these structures, the specifics for continental deposits in the mentioned regions can be harder to pinpoint. 

Previous studies and surveys have attempted to quantify these deposits, but results can vary based on numerous factors. For example, estimates of the global methane clathrate reserves have ranged widely, and extrapolating these figures to specific regions like Siberia, northern Canada, and Alaska requires detailed, localized studies that consider the unique geological and environmental conditions of each area.

Given the current state of research, providing a precise number for the methane clathrates in these continental deposits is challenging. However, it's acknowledged that these regions potentially hold a significant portion of the world's clathrate deposits, contributing to both the global energy resource potential and concerns regarding methane release and climate change. Further research and technological advancements in surveying and modeling will be crucial in refining these estimates and understanding the implications of methane clathrate deposits in continental regions.

The thickness of the clathrate stability zone depends on surface temperature and geothermal gradient. Average stability zone thickness is about 400 m in cold regions where average surface temperatures are below freezing, 500 m in ocean sediments, and up to 1,500 m in regions of very cold surface temperature (<-15 °C) or in the deep ocean. The concentration of methane relative to water within the zone of stability determines whether or not clathrate will actually occur. The geologic setting of clathrate occurrences, the isotopic composition of the methane, and the methane to ethane plus propane ratio in both the clathrates and the associated pore fluids indicate that methane in clathrates is produced chiefly by anaerobic bacteria. Methane occurrences and the organic carbon content of sediments are the bases used to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored as clathrates. The estimate of about 11,000 Gt of carbon for ocean sediments, and about 400 Gt for sediments under permafrost regions is in rough accord with an independent estimate by Kvenvolden of 10,000 Gt.The shallowness of the clathrate zone of stability makes clathrates vulnerable to surface disturbances. Warming by ocean flooding of exposed continental shelf, and changes in pressure at depth, caused, for example, by sea-level drop, destabilize clathrates under the ocean, while ice-cap growth stabilizes clathrates under the ice cap. The time scale for thermal destabilization is set by the thermal properties of sediments and is on the order of thousands of years. The time required to fix methane in clathrates as a result of surface cooling is much longer, requiring several tens of thousands of years. The sensitivity of clathrates to surface change, the time scales involved, and the large quantities of carbon stored as clathrate indicate that clathrates may have played a significant role in modifying the composition of the atmosphere during the ice ages. The release of methane and its subsequent oxidation to carbon dioxide may be responsible for the observed swings in atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial times. Because methane and carbon dioxide are strong infrared absorbers, the release and trapping of methane by clathrates contribute strong feedback mechanisms to the radiative forcing of climate that results from earth's orbital variations.

> part3 -------------------<br>Positive feedbacks through the carbon cycle[edit]<br><br>See also: Carbon cycle<br>The global warming projections contained in the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) include carbon cycle feedbacks. Authors of AR4, however, noted that scientific understanding of carbon cycle feedbacks was poor. Projections in AR4 were based on a range of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and suggested warming between the late 20th and late 21st century of 1.1 to 6.4 °C. This is the "likely" range (greater than 66% probability), based on the expert judgement of the IPCC's authors. Authors noted that the lower end of the "likely" range appeared to be better constrained than the upper end of the "likely" range, in part due to carbon cycle feedbacks. The American Meteorological Society has commented that more research is needed to model the effects of carbon cycle feedbacks in climate change projections.<br>There have been predictions, and some evidence, that global warming might cause loss of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems, leading to an increase of atmospheric CO2 levels. Several climate models indicate that global warming through the 21st century could be accelerated by the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to such warming. All 11 models in the C4MIP study found that a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 will stay airborne if climate change is accounted for. By the end of the twenty-first century, this additional CO2 varied between 20 and 200 ppm for the two extreme models, the majority of the models lying between 50 and 100 ppm. The higher CO2 levels led to an additional climate warming ranging between 0.1° and 1.5 °C. However, there was still a large uncertainty on the magnitude of these sensitivities. Eight models attributed most of the changes to the land, while three attributed it to the ocean. The strongest feedbacks in these cases are due to increased respiration of carbon from soils throughout the high latitude boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. One model in particular (HadCM3) indicates a secondary carbon cycle feedback due to the loss of much of the Amazon Rainforest in response to significantly reduced precipitation over tropical South America. While models disagree on the strength of any terrestrial carbon cycle feedback, they each suggest any such feedback would accelerate global warming.<br>Observations show that soils in the U.K have been losing carbon at the rate of four million tonnes a year for the past 25 years according to a paper in Nature by Bellamy et al. in September 2005, who note that these results are unlikely to be explained by land use changes. Results such as this rely on a dense sampling network and thus are not available on a global scale. Extrapolating to all of the United Kingdom, they estimate annual losses of 13 million tons per year. This is as much as the annual reductions in carbon dioxide emissions achieved by the UK under the Kyoto Treaty (12.7 million tons of carbon per year).<br>It has also been suggested (by Chris Freeman) that the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat bogs into water courses (from which it would in turn enter the atmosphere) constitutes a positive feedback for global warming. The carbon currently stored in peatlands (390–455 gigatonnes, one-third of the total land-based carbon store) is over half the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere. DOC levels in water courses are observably rising; Freeman's hypothesis is that, not elevated temperatures, but elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are responsible, through stimulation of primary productivity.<br>Tree deaths are believed to be increasing as a result of climate change, which is a positive feedback effect.<br>Methane climate feedbacks in natural ecosystems.<br>Wetlands and freshwater ecosystems are predicted to be the largest potential contributor to a global methane climate feedback. Long-term warming changes the balance in the methane-related microbial community within freshwater ecosystems so they produce more methane while proportionately less is oxidised to carbon dioxide.<br>Arctic methane release[edit]<br>Photo shows what appears to be permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay, Canada, near Greenland. (2008) Global warming will increase permafrost and peatland thaw, which can result in collapse of plateau surfaces.<br><br>Main article: Arctic methane release<br>Warming is also the triggering variable for the release of carbon (potentially as methane) in the arctic. Methane released from thawing permafrost such as the frozen peat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates a positive feedback. In April 2019, Turetsky et al. reported permafrost was thawing quicker than predicted. Recently the understanding of the climate feedback from permafrost improved, but potential emissions from the subsea permafrost remain unknown and are - like many other soil carbon feedbacks - still absent from most climate models.<br>Thawing permafrost[edit]<br><br>See also: Permafrost thaw, Permafrost carbon cycle, and Arctic methane release<br>Western Siberia is the world's largest peat bog, a one million square kilometer region of permafrost peat bog that was formed 11,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age. The thawing of its permafrost is likely to lead to the release, over decades, of large quantities of methane. As much as 70,000 million tonnes of methane, an extremely effective greenhouse gas, might be released over the next few decades, creating an additional source of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar thawing has been observed in eastern Siberia. Lawrence et al. (2008) suggest that a rapid melting of Arctic sea ice may start a feedback loop that rapidly melts Arctic permafrost, triggering further warming. May 31, 2010. NASA published that globally "Greenhouse gases are escaping the permafrost and entering the atmosphere at an increasing rate - up to 50 billion tons each year of methane, for example - due to a global thawing trend. This is particularly troublesome because methane heats the atmosphere with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide" (the equivalent of 1250 billion tons of CO2 per year).<br>Researchers have also analysed how carbon released from permafrost might contribute to global warming. A study from 2011 projected changes in permafrost based on a medium greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SRES A1B). According to the study, by 2200, the permafrost feedback might contribute 190 (+/- 64) gigatons of carbon cumulatively to the atmosphere.<br>In 2019, a report called " Arctic report card " estimated the current greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic permafrost as almost equal to the emissions of Russia or Japan or less than 10% of the global emissions from fossil fuels.<br>The Sixth IPCC Assessment Report states that "projections from models of permafrost ecosystems suggest that future permafrost thaw will lead to some additional warming – enough to be important, but not enough to lead to a 'runaway warming' situation, where permafrost thaw leads to a dramatic, self-reinforcing acceleration of global warming."<br>Hydrates[edit]<br><br>Main article: Clathrate gun hypothesis<br>Methane clathrate, also called methane hydrate, is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Extremely large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the sea and ocean floors of Earth. The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits, in a climate tipping event, has been hypothesized as a cause of past and possibly future climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; it is thought that this might increase the global temperature by an additional 5° in itself, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen content of the atmosphere. This theory has been proposed to explain the most severe mass extinction event on earth known as the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and also the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate change event. In 2008, a research expedition for the American Geophysical Union detected levels of methane up to 100 times above normal in the Siberian Arctic, likely being released by methane clathrates being released by holes in a frozen 'lid' of seabed permafrost, around the outfall of the Lena River and the area between the Laptev Sea and East Siberian Sea.<br>In 2020, the first leak of methane from the sea floor in Antarctica was discovered. The scientists are not sure what caused it. The area where it was found had not warmed yet significantly. It is on the side of a volcano, but it seems that it is not from there. The methane-eating microbes consume much less methane than was supposed, and the researchers think this should be included in climate models. They also claim that there is much more to discover about the issue in Antarctica. A quarter of all marine methane is found in the region of Antarctica<br>Abrupt increases in atmospheric methane[edit]<br>Literature assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the US Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) have considered the possibility of future projected climate change leading to a rapid increase in atmospheric methane. The IPCC Third Assessment Report, published in 2001, looked at possible rapid increases in methane due either to reductions in the atmospheric chemical sink or from the release of buried methane reservoirs. In both cases, it was judged that such a release would be "exceptionally unlikely"<br>(less than a 1% chance, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, published in 2008, concluded that an abrupt release of methane into the atmosphere appeared "very unlikely"<br>(less than 10% probability, based on expert judgement).<br>The CCSP assessment, however, noted that climate change would "very likely" (greater than 90% probability, based on expert judgement) accelerate the pace of persistent emissions from both hydrate sources and wetlands.<br>On 10 June 2019 Louise M. Farquharson and her team reported that their 12-year study into Canadian permafrost had "Observed maximum thaw depths at our sites are already exceeding those projected to occur by 2090. Between 1990 and 2016, an increase of up to 4 °C has been observed in terrestrial permafrost and this trend is expected to continue as Arctic mean annual air temperatures increase at a rate twice that of lower latitudes." Determining the extent of new thermokarst development is difficult, but there is little doubt the problem is widespread. Farquharson and her team guess that about 231,000 square miles (600,000 square kilometers) of permafrost, or about 5.5% of the zone that is permafrost year-round, is vulnerable to rapid surface thawing.<br>Decomposition[edit]<br><br>Main article: Decomposition<br>Organic matter stored in permafrost generates heat as it decomposes in response to the permafrost thawing. The amount of carbon stored in the permafrost region is estimated to be around two times the amount of carbon that is in the Earth's atmosphere. As the tropics get wetter, as many climate models predict, soils are likely to experience greater rates of respiration and decomposition, limiting the carbon storage abilities of tropical soils.<br>Peat decomposition[edit]<br>Peat, occurring naturally in peat bogs, is a store of carbon significant on a global scale. When peat dries it decomposes, and may additionally burn. Water table adjustment due to global warming may cause significant excursions of carbon from peat bogs.  This may be released as methane, which can exacerbate the feedback effect, due to its high global warming potential.<br>Rainforest drying[edit]<br>Rainforests, most notably tropical rainforests, are particularly vulnerable to global warming.  There are a number of effects which may occur, but two are particularly concerning.  Firstly, the drier vegetation may cause total collapse of the rainforest ecosystem.  For example, the Amazon rainforest would tend to be replaced by caatinga ecosystems.  Further, even tropical rainforests ecosystems which do not collapse entirely may lose significant proportions of their stored carbon as a result of drying, due to changes in vegetation.<br>Forest fires[edit]<br><br>See also: Wildfire § Climate change effects, and Effects of climate change on biomes<br>The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report predicts that many mid-latitude regions, such as Mediterranean Europe, will experience decreased rainfall and an increased risk of drought, which in turn would allow forest fires to occur on larger scale, and more regularly. This releases more stored carbon into the atmosphere than the carbon cycle can naturally re-absorb, as well as reducing the overall forest area on the planet, creating a positive feedback loop. Part of that feedback loop is more rapid growth of replacement forests and a northward migration of forests as northern latitudes become more suitable climates for sustaining forests. There is a question of whether the burning of renewable fuels such as forests should be counted as contributing to global warming.  Cook & Vizy also found that forest fires were likely in the Amazon Rainforest, eventually resulting in a transition to Caatinga vegetation in the Eastern Amazon region.<br>Desertification[edit]<br>Desertification is a consequence of global warming in some environments.  Desert soils contain little humus, and support little vegetation.  As a result, transition to desert ecosystems is typically associated with excursions of carbon.

The thickness of the clathrate stability zone depends on surface temperature and geothermal gradient. Average stability zone thickness is about 400 m in cold regions where average surface temperatures are below freezing, 500 m in ocean sediments, and up to 1,500 m in regions of very cold surface temperature (<-15 °C) or in the deep ocean. The concentration of methane relative to water within the zone of stability determines whether or not clathrate will actually occur. The geologic setting of clathrate occurrences, the isotopic composition of the methane, and the methane to ethane plus propane ratio in both the clathrates and the associated pore fluids indicate that methane in clathrates is produced chiefly by anaerobic bacteria. Methane occurrences and the organic carbon content of sediments are the bases used to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored as clathrates. The estimate of about 11,000 Gt of carbon for ocean sediments, and about 400 Gt for sediments under permafrost regions is in rough accord with an independent estimate by Kvenvolden of 10,000 Gt.The shallowness of the clathrate zone of stability makes clathrates vulnerable to surface disturbances. Warming by ocean flooding of exposed continental shelf, and changes in pressure at depth, caused, for example, by sea-level drop, destabilize clathrates under the ocean, while ice-cap growth stabilizes clathrates under the ice cap. The time scale for thermal destabilization is set by the thermal properties of sediments and is on the order of thousands of years. The time required to fix methane in clathrates as a result of surface cooling is much longer, requiring several tens of thousands of years. The sensitivity of clathrates to surface change, the time scales involved, and the large quantities of carbon stored as clathrate indicate that clathrates may have played a significant role in modifying the composition of the atmosphere during the ice ages. The release of methane and its subsequent oxidation to carbon dioxide may be responsible for the observed swings in atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial times. Because methane and carbon dioxide are strong infrared absorbers, the release and trapping of methane by clathrates contribute strong feedback mechanisms to the radiative forcing of climate that results from earth's orbital variations.
