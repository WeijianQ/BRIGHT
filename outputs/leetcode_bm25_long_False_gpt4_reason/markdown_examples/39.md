# Query `39`

## Original Question

*You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square_ `(n - 1, n - 1)` _if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,2\],\[1,3\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,2,3,4\],\[24,23,22,21,5\],\[12,13,14,15,16\],\[11,17,18,19,20\],\[10,9,8,7,6\]\]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Constraints:

   `n == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= n <= 50`
   `0 <= grid[i][j] < n2`
   Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum time `t` that allows you to swim from the top left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom right corner `(n - 1, n - 1)` of an `n x n` grid, where each cell in the grid represents an elevation, and you can only swim in cells where the elevation is less than or equal to `t`. This is essentially a pathfinding problem under dynamic conditions, where the condition (water level `t`) changes over time, gradually allowing access to more parts of the grid.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem Space**:
    - The grid represents a map of elevations.
    - The water level increases uniformly across the entire grid.
    - Movement is possible only to adjacent cells (not diagonally) with elevation ≤ current water level `t`.

2. **Key Information**:
    - The water level starts at 0 and increases over time.
    - You can move instantly across any number of cells, as long as the path consists of cells with elevations ≤ `t`.
    - The goal is to reach the bottom right corner from the top left corner in the least amount of time.
    - Each elevation in the grid is unique.

3. **Approach**:
    - **Binary Search on Time**: Since we're looking for the minimum time `t` and we know that time is non-negative and increases the possibility of reaching the target, we can use binary search to find the minimum `t` that allows us to reach the destination. The lower bound of our search is 0, and the upper bound can be the maximum elevation in the grid since it's guaranteed that we can reach any point at or before this time.
    - **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Feasibility**: For a given time `t`, we can use BFS to check if it's possible to reach the bottom right corner from the top left. We start the BFS from `(0, 0)` and consider a cell reachable if its elevation is ≤ `t`. If we can reach `(n - 1, n - 1)`, then `t` is feasible.
    - **Optimization**: Since the problem states that each value in the grid is unique, this ensures there will be a single minimum `t` that allows us to reach the end. Also, the uniqueness helps in simplifying the logic since no two cells will have the same condition at any `t`.

4. **Implementation Details**:
    - Start with `left = 0` and `right = max(grid[i][j])` as the bounds for binary search.
    - Perform binary search. For each mid-value of `left` and `right`, use it as the current water level `t` and perform BFS to check if `(n - 1, n - 1)` is reachable.
        - If reachable, it means we can potentially reach the target in less or equal time, so we adjust `right` to `mid`.
        - If not reachable, we need more time, so we adjust `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - The binary search continues until `left` and `right` converge, at which point `left` (or `right`, since they're equal at this point) is the minimum time required to reach the destination.

### Conclusion

This problem combines elements of graph traversal (to check the feasibility of reaching a certain point under given conditions) and binary search (to efficiently find the minimum time required). By carefully employing both techniques, we can efficiently find the minimum time needed to swim across the grid under the dynamic condition of rising water levels.

You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.<br><br>A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.<br><br>Return _the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell._<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: heights = \[\[1,2,2\],\[3,8,2\],\[5,3,5\]\]<br>Output: 2<br>Explanation: The route of \[1,3,5,3,5\] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.<br>This is better than the route of \[1,2,2,2,5\], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: heights = \[\[1,2,3\],\[3,8,4\],\[5,3,5\]\]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: The route of \[1,2,3,4,5\] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route \[1,3,5,3,5\].<br><br>Example 3:<br><br>Input: heights = \[\[1,2,1,1,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,1,1,2,1\]\]<br>Output: 0<br>Explanation: This route does not require any effort.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `rows == heights.length`<br>   `columns == heights[i].length`<br>   `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`<br>   `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`"""<br><br>    odd, even, sum_, result = 0, 1, 0, 0<br>    mod = 109 + 7<br>    for x in arr:<br>        sum_ = (sum_ + x) % 2<br>        if sum_ % 2 == 0:<br>            even += 1<br>        else:<br>            odd += 1<br>        result = (result + odd) % mod<br>    return result
