# Query `122`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `stockPrices` where `stockPrices[i] = [dayi, pricei]` indicates the price of the stock on day `dayi` is `pricei`. A line chart is created from the array by plotting the points on an XY plane with the X-axis representing the day and the Y-axis representing the price and connecting adjacent points. One such example is shown below:

Return _the minimum number of lines needed to represent the line chart_.

Example 1:

Input: stockPrices = \[\[1,7\],\[2,6\],\[3,5\],\[4,4\],\[5,4\],\[6,3\],\[7,2\],\[8,1\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The diagram above represents the input, with the X-axis representing the day and Y-axis representing the price.
The following 3 lines can be drawn to represent the line chart:
- Line 1 (in red) from (1,7) to (4,4) passing through (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), and (4,4).
- Line 2 (in blue) from (4,4) to (5,4).
- Line 3 (in green) from (5,4) to (8,1) passing through (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), and (8,1).
It can be shown that it is not possible to represent the line chart using less than 3 lines.

Example 2:

Input: stockPrices = \[\[3,4\],\[1,2\],\[7,8\],\[2,3\]\]
Output: 1
Explanation:
As shown in the diagram above, the line chart can be represented with a single line.

Constraints:

   `1 <= stockPrices.length <= 105`
   `stockPrices[i].length == 2`
   `1 <= dayi, pricei <= 109`
   All `dayi` are distinct.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the minimum number of straight lines required to connect all the given points on a 2D plane, where each point represents the price of a stock on a given day. This problem essentially boils down to finding segments of points that lie on the same line when the points are plotted in chronological order based on the day.

### Key Considerations:

1. **Sorting the Points:** Since the input points might not be in the chronological order of days, the first step is to sort the `stockPrices` array based on the `dayi` values. This ensures we are considering the progression of stock prices in the correct temporal sequence.

2. **Determining Collinearity:** To decide if points can be connected by a single line (i.e., they are collinear), we need to check if the slope between consecutive points remains constant. The slope between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) can be calculated as \(\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1}\). However, to avoid division (and potential division by zero issues), we can compare slopes by cross multiplication, i.e., checking if \((y2 - y1) * (x3 - x2) = (y3 - y2) * (x2 - x1)\) for three consecutive points \((x1, y1)\), \((x2, y2)\), and \((x3, y3)\).

3. **Iterating Through Points:** By iterating through the sorted list of points, we can check if the current point can be connected to the previous line segment (if the slope hasn't changed) or if a new line needs to be started. The first point or a change in slope indicates the need to start a new line.

### Step by Step Solution:

1. **Sort `stockPrices` by day:** This ensures that we're looking at the stock prices in the correct order.

2. **Initialize line count:** Start with a count of 0 lines.

3. **Iterate through sorted points:** For each point after the first, calculate the slope between it and the previous point. If this is the first point or if the slope changes from the previous segment, increment the line count.

    - To calculate and compare slopes without actual division, use the cross multiplication method mentioned above.
    - Keep track of the "current slope" between the last two points to compare with the slope to the next point.

4. **Return the line count:** After iterating through all points, the line count will represent the minimum number of lines needed to connect all points in a manner that reflects the progression of stock prices over time.

### Relevant Information:

- **Collinearity Detection:** Detecting a change in slope (and hence the need for a new line) is crucial. This involves comparing the slopes between consecutive segments.

- **Edge Cases:** Special attention might be needed for vertical lines (where \(x2 = x1\)), although in the context of this problem (where each day is unique), this situation should not occur.

- **Efficiency:** The approach is quite efficient, primarily limited by the sorting step, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of stock price records. The iteration and slope comparison steps are linear in complexity, \(O(n)\).

In summary, the problem is fundamentally about identifying segments of points that can be connected by straight lines, with the solution revolving around sorting, slope comparison, and careful iteration through the points.
