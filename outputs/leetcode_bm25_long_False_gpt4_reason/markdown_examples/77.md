# Query `77`

## Original Question

*You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi]`:

   `numberOfBoxesi` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
   `numberOfUnitsPerBoxi` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

Return _the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck._

Example 1:

Input: boxTypes = \[\[1,3\],\[2,2\],\[3,1\]\], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:
- 1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.
- 2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.
- 3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 \ 3) + (2 \ 2) + (1 \ 1) = 8.

Example 2:

Input: boxTypes = \[\[5,10\],\[2,5\],\[4,7\],\[3,9\]\], truckSize = 10
Output: 91

Constraints:

   `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
   `1 <= numberOfBoxesi, numberOfUnitsPerBoxi <= 1000`
   `1 <= truckSize <= 106`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to maximize the total number of units that can be put on the truck, given constraints on the number of boxes that can be placed on the truck (truckSize) and the varying quantities of units within each box type. The challenge involves making a strategic choice about which boxes to load onto the truck to achieve the maximum total units, without exceeding the truck's box capacity limit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Sort the Box Types by Units**: Since our goal is to maximize the number of units on the truck, we should prioritize loading boxes with the highest number of units per box. Therefore, the first step is to sort the `boxTypes` array in descending order based on the number of units per box (`numberOfUnitsPerBoxi`).

2. **Load the Boxes onto the Truck**: After sorting, we need to iterate through the sorted `boxTypes` and start loading the boxes onto the truck. We'll keep track of two things: the total number of boxes loaded so far (to ensure we don't exceed `truckSize`) and the total number of units loaded onto the truck.

3. **Iterate Until the Truck is Full**: For each box type, we'll decide if we can load all boxes of that type onto the truck or just a portion of them (if loading all would exceed the `truckSize`). If we can load all, we add all the units from those boxes to our total units count and move to the next box type. If we can only load a portion, we calculate how many more boxes can fit, add the corresponding number of units to our total, and then stop the process since the truck is full.

4. **Calculate the Total Units**: The process continues until we either run out of box types to check or the truck reaches its capacity (`truckSize`). The total number of units accumulated by this process is the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.

### Relevant Information:

- The `truckSize` is the maximum number of boxes (not units) that the truck can carry.
- Each box type has a specific number of units per box, which influences our loading strategy (prioritizing box types with more units per box).
- The constraints ensure that the problem size is manageable and that all inputs are positive integers.

### Draft Answer:

To solve this problem, we would implement the following steps in code:

1. **Sort** the `boxTypes` array based on the number of units per box in descending order.
2. **Initialize** two variables: `totalUnits` (to keep track of the total number of units loaded onto the truck) and `boxesLoaded` (to keep track of the number of boxes loaded so far).
3. **Iterate** through the sorted `boxTypes`, for each type:
   - Determine if we can load all boxes of this type without exceeding `truckSize`. If yes, add all their units to `totalUnits` and increase `boxesLoaded` accordingly.
   - If adding all boxes of the current type would exceed `truckSize`, calculate how many more boxes can fit, multiply this by the number of units per box for this type, add this to `totalUnits`, and update `boxesLoaded`.
   - If `boxesLoaded` reaches `truckSize`, break the loop as the truck is full.
4. **Return** the `totalUnits` as the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.

This approach ensures that we always prioritize loading the boxes with the highest unit count first, maximizing the total number of units loaded onto the truck within the given capacity constraints.

A minimum of 10<br>            (the default) iterations guarantees that, on average, 2<br>            iterations will be available for fitting each independent<br>            parameter (the four harmonic amplitudes and the intensity<br>            level). For the first isophote, the minimum number of<br>            iterations is 2  ``minit`` to ensure that, even departing<br>            from not-so-good initial values, the algorithm has a better<br>            chance to converge to a sensible solution.<br>        maxit : int, optional<br>            The maximum number of iterations to perform.  The default is<br>            50.<br>        fflag : float, optional<br>            The acceptable fraction of flagged data points in the<br>            sample.  If the actual fraction of valid data points is<br>            smaller than this, the iterations will stop and the current<br>            `~photutils.isophote.Isophote` will be returned.  Flagged<br>            data points are points that either lie outside the image<br>            frame, are masked, or were rejected by sigma-clipping.  The<br>            default is 0.7.<br>        maxgerr : float, optional<br>            The maximum acceptable relative error in the local radial<br>            intensity gradient. This is the main control for preventing<br>            ellipses to grow to regions of too low signal-to-noise<br>            ratio.  It specifies the maximum acceptable relative error<br>            in the local radial intensity gradient.  `Busko (1996; ASPC<br>            101, 139)<br>            <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ASPC..101..139B`_ showed<br>            that the fitting precision relates to that relative error.<br>            The usual behavior of the gradient relative error is to<br>            increase with semimajor axis, being larger in outer, fainter<br>            regions of a galaxy image.  In the current implementation,<br>            the ``maxgerr`` criterion is triggered only when two<br>            consecutive isophotes exceed the value specified by the<br>            parameter. This prevents premature stopping caused by<br>            contamination such as stars and HII regions.<br><br>            A number of actions may happen when the gradient error<br>            exceeds ``maxgerr`` (or becomes non-significant and is set<br>            to `None`).  If the maximum semimajor axis specified by<br>            ``maxsma`` is set to `None`, semimajor axis growth is<br>            stopped and the algorithm proceeds inwards to the galaxy<br>            center. If ``maxsma`` is set to some finite value, and this<br>            value is larger than the current semimajor axis length, the<br>            algorithm enters non-iterative mode and proceeds outwards<br>            until reaching ``maxsma``.  The default is 0.5.<br>        sclip : float, optional<br>            The sigma-clip sigma value.  The default is 3.0.<br>        nclip : int, optional<br>            The number of sigma-clip interations.  The default is 0,<br>            which means sigma-clipping is skipped.<br>        integrmode : {'bilinear', 'nearest_neighbor', 'mean', 'median'}, optional<br>            The area integration mode.  The default is 'bilinear'.<br>        linear : bool, optional<br>            The semimajor axis growing/shrinking mode. If `False`<br>            (default), the geometric growing mode is chosen, thus the<br>            semimajor axis length is increased by a factor of (1. +<br>            ``step``), and the process is repeated until either the<br>            semimajor axis value reaches the value of parameter<br>            ``maxsma``, or the last fitted ellipse has more than a given<br>            fraction of its sampled points flagged out (see ``fflag``).<br>            The process then resumes from the first fitted ellipse (at<br>            ``sma0``) inwards, in steps of (1./(1. + ``step``)), until<br>            the semimajor axis length reaches the value ``minsma``. In<br>            case of linear growing, the increment or decrement value is<br>            given directly by ``step`` in pixels.  If ``maxsma`` is set<br>            to `None`, the semimajor axis will grow until a low<br>            signal-to-noise criterion is met. See ``maxgerr``.<br>        maxrit : float or `None`, optional<br>            The maximum value of semimajor axis to perform an actual<br>            fit.  Whenever the current semimajor axis length is larger<br>            than ``maxrit``, the isophotes will be extracted using the<br>            current geometry, without being fitted.  This non-iterative<br>            mode may be useful for sampling regions of very low surface<br>            brightness, where the algorithm may become unstable and<br>            unable to recover reliable geometry information.<br>            Non-iterative mode can also be entered automatically<br>            whenever the ellipticity exceeds 1.0 or the ellipse center<br>            crosses the image boundaries.  If `None` (default), then no<br>            maximum value is used.<br><br>        Returns<br>        -------<br>        result : `~photutils.isophote.IsophoteList` instance<br>            A list-like object of `~photutils.isophote.Isophote`<br>            instances, sorted by increasing semimajor axis length.<br>        """<br><br>        # multiple fitted isophotes will be stored here<br>        isophote_list = []<br><br>        # get starting sma from appropriate source: keyword parameter,<br>        # internal EllipseGeometry instance, or fixed default value.<br>        if not sma0:<br>            if self._geometry:<br>                sma = self._geometry.sma<br>            else:<br>                sma = 10.<br>        else:<br>            sma = sma0<br><br>        # first, go from initial sma outwards until<br>        # hitting one of several stopping criteria.<br>        noiter = False<br>        first_isophote = True<br>        while True:<br>            # first isophote runs longer<br>            minit_a = 2  minit if first_isophote else minit<br>            first_isophote = False<br><br>            isophote = self.fit_isophote(sma, step, conver, minit_a, maxit,<br>                                         fflag, maxgerr, sclip, nclip,<br>                                         integrmode, linear, maxrit,<br>                                         noniterate=noiter,<br>                                         isophote_list=isophote_list)<br><br>            # check for failed fit.<br>            if (isophote.stop_code < 0 or isophote.stop_code == 1):<br>                # in case the fit failed right at the outset, return an<br>                # empty list.
