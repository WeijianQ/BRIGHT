# Query `0`

## Original Question

*Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

Input: height = \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array \[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1\]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:

Input: height = \[4,2,0,3,2,5\]
Output: 9

Constraints:

   `n == height.length`
   `1 <= n <= 2  104`
   `0 <= height[i] <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped by the bars on the elevation map. The elevation map is represented by an array of non-negative integers, where each integer represents the height of a bar (or a section of the elevation). The width of each bar is 1 unit. To solve this problem, we need to understand how water is trapped between bars: water can only be trapped between two taller bars, and the amount of trapped water depends on the height difference and the distance between these bars.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understand the Elevation Map**: Each element in the input array represents the height of a bar at that index. The difference in height between adjacent bars can potentially trap water.

2. **Identify the Left and Right Boundaries**: For any bar, water can only be trapped if there are taller (or equal height) bars on both its left and right sides. The amount of water trapped above a bar is determined by the height of the lower of these two boundaries minus the height of the bar itself.

3. **Calculating Water Above Each Bar**:
    - **Left Max for Each Bar**: Iterate from left to right, keeping track of the maximum height encountered so far. This gives us the maximum height to the left of each bar.
    - **Right Max for Each Bar**: Similarly, iterate from right to left to find the maximum height to the right of each bar.
    - The water trapped on top of each bar is the minimum of its left max and right max, minus the height of the bar itself (since water flows off the top). If this value is negative, it means no water is trapped on that bar.

4. **Summing Up Trapped Water**: By calculating the trapped water above each bar and summing it up, we get the total amount of water trapped.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: 
    - If the array has less than 3 bars, no water can be trapped.
    - The input constraints assure us that the solution will not require handling numbers outside the range of standard integer types.

### Example

Consider the example `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`:
- For the bar at index 2 (height 0), the highest bar to the left is at index 1 (height 1), and the highest bar to the right is at index 7 (height 3). So, the water trapped above bar 2 is `min(1, 3) - 0 = 1`.
- By performing similar calculations for each bar and summing the trapped water, we find the total trapped water.

### Implementation Notes

This problem can be solved efficiently in O(n) time using O(n) extra space to store the left max and right max for each bar. A two-pass solution first calculates these arrays, and then a third pass calculates the trapped water. Optimizations can reduce the space complexity, but the basic approach remains the same.
