# Query `97`

## Original Question

*There is a binary tree rooted at `0` consisting of `n` nodes. The nodes are labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `parents` representing the tree, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parents[0] == -1`.

Each node has a score. To find the score of a node, consider if the node and the edges connected to it were removed. The tree would become one or more non-empty subtrees. The size of a subtree is the number of the nodes in it. The score of the node is the product of the sizes of all those subtrees.

Return _the number of nodes that have the highest score_.

Example 1:

Input: parents = \[-1,2,0,2,0\]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 3 \ 1 = 3
- The score of node 1 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 2 is: 1 \ 1 \ 2 = 2
- The score of node 3 is: 4 = 4
- The score of node 4 is: 4 = 4
The highest score is 4, and three nodes (node 1, node 3, and node 4) have the highest score.

Example 2:

Input: parents = \[-1,2,0\]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The score of node 0 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 1 is: 2 = 2
- The score of node 2 is: 1 \ 1 = 1
The highest score is 2, and two nodes (node 0 and node 1) have the highest score.

Constraints:

   `n == parents.length`
   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `parents[0] == -1`
   `0 <= parents[i] <= n - 1` for `i != 0`
   `parents` represents a valid binary tree.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the score of each node in a binary tree, where the score is defined as the product of the sizes of all subtrees formed when the node and its connected edges are removed. After calculating the scores, we need to find how many nodes share the highest score. Let's break down the problem into steps and consider the relevant information needed at each step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Tree Structure
Given an array `parents` where `parents[i]` represents the parent of node `i`, we need to construct a mental or programmatic model of the tree. Since it's a binary tree, each node can have at most two children. This information is implicit in the `parents` array, but we'll need to restructure it to easily navigate the tree.

### Step 2: Calculating Subtree Sizes
Before we can calculate the scores, we need to know the size of the subtree rooted at each node. This requires a post-order traversal of the tree, where we calculate and store the size of each subtree. The size of a subtree rooted at a node is 1 (the node itself) plus the sum of the sizes of its children's subtrees.

### Step 3: Calculating Scores
To calculate the score of a node, we need to consider the sizes of the subtrees that would be formed if the node were removed. There are three types of "subtrees" to consider for each node:
- The size of the subtree rooted at the node's left child.
- The size of the subtree rooted at the node's right child.
- The size of the "subtree" that includes the rest of the tree outside of the node's own subtree. This can be calculated as the total size of the tree minus the size of the subtree rooted at the node.

The score of a node is the product of these sizes, taking care to treat missing children (i.e., if a node has no left or right child) as contributing a factor of 1 to the product.

### Step 4: Identifying the Highest Score
As we calculate the scores, we need to keep track of the highest score seen so far and how many times we've encountered it. This requires maintaining a variable for the highest score and a count of how many nodes have that score.

### Step 5: Edge Cases
- If a node is a leaf, its score is simply the size of the tree minus 1 (since removing the leaf only leaves the rest of the tree as a single subtree).
- If a node is the root, its score is the product of the sizes of its children's subtrees (since removing the root leaves no "outside" subtree).

### Summary of Steps
1. **Reconstruct the Tree**: Convert the `parents` array into a more navigable tree structure.
2. **Calculate Subtree Sizes**: Perform a post-order traversal to calculate and store the size of each subtree.
3. **Calculate Scores**: For each node, calculate the score based on the sizes of the subtrees formed when the node is removed.
4. **Track Highest Scores**: Keep track of the highest score and count nodes that achieve this score.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Specifically account for leaf nodes and the root node in score calculations.

### Final Thoughts
This problem combines tree traversal, dynamic programming (to efficiently calculate and store subtree sizes), and some careful consideration of edge cases. The overall complexity is likely O(n) since each node needs to be visited at least once to calculate the subtree sizes and scores.
