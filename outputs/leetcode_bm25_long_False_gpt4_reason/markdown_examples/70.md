# Query `70`

## Original Question

*You are given an `m x n` binary grid `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`'s.

The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise is said disconnected.

In one day, we are allowed to change any single land cell `(1)` into a water cell `(0)`.

Return _the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid_.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,1,0\],\[0,1,1,0\],\[0,0,0,0\]\]

Output: 2
Explanation: We need at least 2 days to get a disconnected grid.
Change land grid\[1\]\[1\] and grid\[0\]\[2\] to water and get 2 disconnected island.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[1,1\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: Grid of full water is also disconnected (\[\[1,1\]\] -> \[\[0,0\]\]), 0 islands.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 30`
   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum number of days required to transform a given binary grid from a state where it represents a connected island (or islands) into a state where it is disconnected, meaning there are either zero or multiple islands, by converting land cells (1's) into water cells (0's). To solve this, we need to understand and analyze the connectivity of the grid, identifying strategic points whose conversion leads to the desired disconnected state in the minimum number of steps.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Island Connectivity**:
   - An island is defined as a group of connected 1's (land cells) where the connection is horizontal or vertical but not diagonal.
   - A grid is connected if there is exactly one island; otherwise, it is disconnected.

2. **Identifying Key Cells**:
   - To disconnect an island efficiently, we must identify land cells whose conversion to water would split the island into separate parts or isolate it completely from other land cells.

3. **Edge and Corner Cells**:
   - Edge and corner cells are critical because they often require fewer changes to affect the island's connectivity. For example, converting a corner cell might only require one change to disconnect an island, whereas a central cell might require changes to multiple neighboring cells.

4. **Minimum Number of Days**:
   - In most grid configurations, converting at least one cell is necessary to disrupt the connectivity. However, the minimum number of days can vary based on the grid's initial configuration.

### Relevant Information

- **Grid Size and Shape**: The grid's dimensions can influence the strategy since larger grids might offer more options for disconnection but also might require more steps to identify the optimal cells for conversion.
- **Initial Distribution of Land and Water**: The placement of 1's and 0's initially can drastically affect the strategy. A grid with a single large island might require a different approach than a grid with several tightly connected islands.
- **Optimal Cells for Conversion**: Identifying cells that, when converted, lead to immediate disconnection or significantly reduce connectivity, is crucial. These are typically found at narrow connections between parts of an island or at strategic points that, when converted, isolate large sections of the island.

### Draft Answer

Given the constraints and the problem's nature, we can infer a few key strategies for finding the minimum number of days to disconnect the grid:

1. **One-Day Disconnections**: In some cases, converting a single strategically located cell can disconnect the island. This is especially true for grids where the island forms a narrow shape or where a single cell connects two larger parts of the island.
   
2. **Two-Day Disconnections**: If no single cell can disconnect the island, the next step is to look for pairs of cells whose conversion leads to disconnection. This often involves looking for cells that, when both are converted, either isolate parts of the island or reduce the island to water completely.

3. **Corner and Edge Cases**: Specifically, in smaller grids or grids with specific configurations, converting corner or edge cells can be the most efficient way to achieve disconnection.

4. **General Case and Observation**: For most grids, especially larger ones, we can observe that the minimum number of days required will not exceed 2. This is because:
   - If the grid forms a single, compact island, converting any border cell will start the process of disconnection.
   - If the island is already in a shape that allows for easy disconnection, converting one or two specific cells can achieve the goal.

Therefore, the answer to the problem will often be 1 or 2, depending on the initial configuration of the grid. The key is to analyze the grid's connectivity and identify those cells whose conversion most efficiently disrupts that connectivity.
