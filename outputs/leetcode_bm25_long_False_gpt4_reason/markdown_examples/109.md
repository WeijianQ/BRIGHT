# Query `109`

## Original Question

*A generic microwave supports cooking times for:

   at least `1` second.
   at most `99` minutes and `99` seconds.

To set the cooking time, you push at most four digits. The microwave normalizes what you push as four digits by prepending zeroes. It interprets the first two digits as the minutes and the last two digits as the seconds. It then adds them up as the cooking time. For example,

   You push `9` `5` `4` (three digits). It is normalized as `0954` and interpreted as `9` minutes and `54` seconds.
   You push `0` `0` `0` `8` (four digits). It is interpreted as `0` minutes and `8` seconds.
   You push `8` `0` `9` `0`. It is interpreted as `80` minutes and `90` seconds.
   You push `8` `1` `3` `0`. It is interpreted as `81` minutes and `30` seconds.

You are given integers `startAt`, `moveCost`, `pushCost`, and `targetSeconds`. Initially, your finger is on the digit `startAt`. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs `moveCost` units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs `pushCost` units of fatigue.

There can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for `targetSeconds` seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.

Return _the minimum cost to set_ `targetSeconds` _seconds of cooking time_.

Remember that one minute consists of `60` seconds.

Example 1:

Input: startAt = 1, moveCost = 2, pushCost = 1, targetSeconds = 600
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the possible ways to set the cooking time.
- 1 0 0 0, interpreted as 10 minutes and 0 seconds.
  The finger is already on digit 1, pushes 1 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), pushes 0 (with cost 1), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. This is the minimum cost.
- 0 9 6 0, interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds. That is also 600 seconds.
  The finger moves to 0 (with cost 2), pushes 0 (with cost 1), moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12.
- 9 6 0, normalized as 0960 and interpreted as 9 minutes and 60 seconds.
  The finger moves to 9 (with cost 2), pushes 9 (with cost 1), moves to 6 (with cost 2), pushes 6 (with cost 1), moves to 0 (with cost 2), and pushes 0 (with cost 1).
  The cost is: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9.

Example 2:

Input: startAt = 0, moveCost = 1, pushCost = 2, targetSeconds = 76
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal way is to push two digits: 7 6, interpreted as 76 seconds.
The finger moves to 7 (with cost 1), pushes 7 (with cost 2), moves to 6 (with cost 1), and pushes 6 (with cost 2). The total cost is: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6
Note other possible ways are 0076, 076, 0116, and 116, but none of them produces the minimum cost.

Constraints:

   `0 <= startAt <= 9`
   `1 <= moveCost, pushCost <= 105`
   `1 <= targetSeconds <= 6039`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the most efficient (cost-effective) way to set a microwave to cook for a specific duration, given as `targetSeconds`, considering the constraints of moving and pushing costs. The microwave's interface and input method require a strategic approach to minimize the total cost based on initial finger position (`startAt`), cost to move the finger (`moveCost`), and cost to push a button (`pushCost`).

### Step 1: Understand the Microwave's Input System

The microwave normalizes input to four digits, interpreting the first two as minutes and the last two as seconds. This system allows for a range of 1 second to 99 minutes and 99 seconds, but the input method (up to four digits) and normalization process (prepending zeros) offer multiple ways to achieve the same cooking time. 

### Step 2: Convert Target Time to Various Input Formats

First, convert `targetSeconds` to a combination of minutes and seconds, understanding that 60 seconds make a minute. This conversion is not always straightforward because the input system allows for overloading seconds (e.g., 80 minutes and 90 seconds is a valid input for 81 minutes and 30 seconds). Thus, you need to consider different combinations of minutes and seconds that normalize to the target time.

### Step 3: Calculate Costs for Each Input Option

For each valid input combination, calculate the total cost, considering:
- The cost to move the finger to each digit from its current position or the previous digit.
- The cost to push each digit.
- The initial position of the finger (`startAt`) affects the first move cost.

### Step 4: Minimize the Total Cost

- **Starting Position Advantage**: If the first digit of the optimal input sequence matches `startAt`, the initial move cost is zero. This can significantly reduce the total cost.
- **Reducing Digit Count**: Shorter sequences may reduce the total cost, especially if `moveCost` is high. For example, inputting `76` for 76 seconds is cheaper than `0076` or `0116`.
- **Sequence Optimization**: It's sometimes less costly to input a slightly different time that normalizes to the desired target but requires fewer or cheaper moves and pushes.

### Step 5: Algorithmic Approach

1. **Convert the Target Time**: Break down `targetSeconds` into all possible minute-second combinations, including those that take advantage of the microwave's normalization rules.
2. **Calculate Costs for Each Combination**: For each combination, calculate the total cost based on moving and pushing costs, starting from `startAt`.
3. **Compare Costs**: Keep track of the minimum cost found while iterating through the combinations.
4. **Return the Minimum Cost**: After evaluating all combinations, the lowest cost found is the answer.

### Example Analysis

Taking the first example with `startAt = 1`, `moveCost = 2`, `pushCost = 1`, and `targetSeconds = 600`:
- Direct input as `1000` (10 minutes) is the cheapest, costing 6 units.
- This involves no moves if starting at `1`, and four pushes.

In essence, solving this problem involves a combination of digit manipulation, understanding the input normalization process, and cost-benefit analysis based on the provided costs and starting conditions.
