# Query `141`

## Original Question

*There are two mice and `n` different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index `i` (0-indexed) is:

   `reward1[i]` if the first mouse eats it.
   `reward2[i]` if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array `reward1`, a positive integer array `reward2`, and a non-negative integer `k`.

Return _the maximum points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly_ `k` _types of cheese._

Example 1:

Input: reward1 = \[1,1,3,4\], reward2 = \[4,4,1,1\], k = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

Example 2:

Input: reward1 = \[1,1\], reward2 = \[1,1\], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 0th (0-indexed) and 1st types of cheese, and the second mouse does not eat any cheese.
The total points are 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n == reward1.length == reward2.length <= 105`
   `1 <= reward1[i], reward2[i] <= 1000`
   `0 <= k <= n`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to maximize the total points gained by two mice eating cheese, with the constraint that the first mouse must eat exactly `k` types of cheese. To solve this, we need to carefully select which cheese types are eaten by which mouse to maximize the overall points.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given two arrays, `reward1` and `reward2`, each representing the points gained if a type of cheese is eaten by the first and second mouse, respectively. The goal is to maximize the total points under the constraint that the first mouse eats exactly `k` types of cheese.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
To maximize the points:
1. **Identify Cheese Selection for Maximum Points**: For each type of cheese, determine which mouse eating it would yield more points. This can be done by comparing the corresponding values in `reward1` and `reward2`.
2. **Selection Strategy**: After determining which mouse should ideally eat which cheese for maximum individual gains, we need to balance this with the constraint that the first mouse eats exactly `k` types.
3. **Calculate the Difference**: To effectively distribute the cheese types, consider the difference in points for each cheese type between being eaten by the first or the second mouse. This difference can guide us in making selections that minimally reduce the total points when adhering to the `k` constraint.

### Step 3: Implement the Strategy
1. **Calculate Point Differences**: For each cheese type, calculate the difference in points between the two mice eating it (`reward1[i] - reward2[i]`). This helps identify which cheese provides more benefit to which mouse.
2. **Sort by Difference**: Sort the cheese types based on these differences. Cheese types with a higher difference are more beneficial for the first mouse, and those with a lower or negative difference are more beneficial for the second mouse.
3. **Select Cheese for the First Mouse**: Select the `k` types of cheese that have the highest positive difference for the first mouse. This ensures that the first mouse is eating the cheese that maximizes its points contribution.
4. **Select Cheese for the Second Mouse**: The remaining cheese types should be considered for the second mouse. Since we've sorted by the difference, selecting the rest for the second mouse should naturally optimize for the highest points possible under the given constraint.
5. **Calculate Total Points**: Sum the points based on the selection strategy above to find the maximum total points.

### Example Walkthrough
Given `reward1 = [1,1,3,4]`, `reward2 = [4,4,1,1]`, and `k = 2`:
1. **Calculate Differences**: Differences are `[-3, -3, 2, 3]`.
2. **Sort by Difference**: Sorting by difference, we prioritize cheese types for the first mouse with higher differences, but we must select exactly `k=2`, which leads us to select the last two cheeses for the first mouse.
3. **Selection**:
   - First Mouse: Selects cheese with indices 2 and 3 (3 + 4 points).
   - Second Mouse: Selects cheese with indices 0 and 1 (4 + 4 points).
4. **Total Points**: The total points are `4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15`.

This approach ensures that we are making an optimal selection of cheese types for both mice while adhering to the constraint for the first mouse.
