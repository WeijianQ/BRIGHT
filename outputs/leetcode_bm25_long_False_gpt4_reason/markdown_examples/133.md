# Query `133`

## Original Question

*There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

At every node `i`, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers `amount`, where `amount[i]` represents:

   the price needed to open the gate at node `i`, if `amount[i]` is negative, or,
   the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node `i`, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

   Initially, Alice is at node `0` and Bob is at node `bob`.
   At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node `0`.
   For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
       If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
       If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is `c`, then both Alice and Bob pay `c / 2` each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is `c`, both of them receive `c / 2` each.
   If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node `0`, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

Return _the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node._

Example 1:

Input: edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\],\[3,4\]\], bob = 3, amount = \[-2,4,2,-4,6\]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Example 2:

Input: edges = \[\[0,1\]\], bob = 1, amount = \[-7280,2350\]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. 

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `edges.length == n - 1`
   `edges[i].length == 2`
   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
   `ai != bi`
   `edges` represents a valid tree.
   `1 <= bob < n`
   `amount.length == n`
   `amount[i]` is an even integer in the range `[-104, 104]`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to maximize Alice's net income by choosing the optimal path towards a leaf node in a tree, considering the costs and rewards of opening gates, as well as the movements of Bob who is moving towards the root of the tree. This problem involves several key considerations:

1. **Tree Structure and Paths**: Since the input defines an undirected tree rooted at node `0`, understanding the tree's structure is crucial. The tree's structure will determine the paths Alice and Bob can take. Alice aims to move towards a leaf node, while Bob moves towards the root node (`0`).

2. **Costs and Rewards**: The `amount` array represents the cost or reward at each node. A negative value indicates a cost to open the gate, while a positive value indicates a reward. These costs and rewards directly affect Alice's net income.

3. **Simultaneous Arrivals**: If Alice and Bob arrive at a node simultaneously, they share the cost or reward. This aspect is crucial for calculating the net income, as sharing costs can reduce expenses, and sharing rewards affects the total income.

4. **Optimal Path for Alice**: The goal is to find the path that maximizes Alice's net income. This involves not just looking at the rewards but also considering the costs and the influence of Bob's movements.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning and Relevant Information

- **Tree Analysis**: First, we need to understand the tree's structure from the `edges` array. This involves creating a representation of the tree that allows us to navigate from any node to its adjacent nodes. This representation will help in understanding the possible paths Alice can take towards a leaf node and Bob towards the root.

- **Paths and Movements**: We need to track the paths that Alice and Bob will take. Since Alice moves towards a leaf node and Bob towards the root, identifying these paths is critical. For Alice, the choice of the leaf node will determine her path. For Bob, the path is fixed towards the root.

- **Calculating Costs and Rewards**: As Alice and Bob move, we need to calculate the costs and rewards at each node they pass through, including when they arrive simultaneously. This calculation will involve checking the `amount` array and determining if the cost/reward should be shared or not.

- **Optimization**: To maximize Alice's net income, we need to consider all possible leaf nodes Alice can move towards and calculate the net income for each path. This involves not just looking at the maximum reward but also minimizing costs, including the effects of sharing costs/rewards with Bob.

- **Dynamic Programming or DFS Approach**: Solving this problem efficiently might require dynamic programming or a depth-first search (DFS) approach, where we explore all possible paths for Alice and calculate the net income for each path. This process will involve memoization or tracking visited nodes to avoid recalculations and optimize the search.

### Solution Draft

1. **Construct the Tree**: Use the `edges` array to construct a representation of the tree. This could be an adjacency list that maps each node to its neighbors.

2. **Identify Paths**: For Bob, the path is straightforward towards the root. For Alice, we need to explore all paths towards leaf nodes. This exploration can be done using DFS.

3. **Calculate Net Income**: For each path Alice takes, calculate the net income by adding rewards and subtracting costs. When a node is visited by both Alice and Bob simultaneously, adjust the calculation to account for shared costs/rewards.

4. **Optimization**: Explore all possible paths for Alice and keep track of the maximum net income found. This will involve comparing the net income of each path and selecting the maximum.

5. **Return the Maximum Net Income**: After exploring all paths, return the maximum net income Alice can achieve.

This approach requires careful implementation to ensure all aspects of the problem are considered, including the tree structure, movement of Alice and Bob, and the calculation of costs and rewards.

If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.<br><br>   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.<br><br>Return _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n2`_. If it is not possible to reach the square, return_ `-1`.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: board = \[\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1\]\]<br>Output: 4<br>Explanation: <br>In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).<br>You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.<br>You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.<br>You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.<br>You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.<br>This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: board = \[\[-1,-1\],\[-1,3\]\]<br>Output: 1<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `n == board.length == board[i].length`<br>   `2 <= n <= 20`<br>   `board[i][j]` is either `-1` or in the range `[1, n2]`.<br>   The squares labeled `1` and `n2` do not have any ladders or snakes."""<br><br>    n = len(piles)<br>    dp = [[0]  n for _ in range(n)]<br>    for gap in range(n):<br>        for i in range(n - gap):<br>            j = i + gap<br>            x = dp[i + 2][j] if i + 2 <= j else 0<br>            y = dp[i + 1][j - 1] if i + 1 <= j - 1 else 0<br>            z = dp[i][j - 2] if i <= j - 2 else 0<br>            dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] + min(x, y), piles[j] + min(y, z))<br>    sum_of_piles = sum(piles)<br>    return dp[0][n - 1]  (sum_of_piles - dp[0][n - 1])
