# Query `63`

## Original Question

*You are given the string `croakOfFrogs`, which represents a combination of the string `"croak "` from different frogs, that is, multiple frogs can croak at the same time, so multiple `"croak "` are mixed.

_Return the minimum number of_ different _frogs to finish all the croaks in the given string._

A valid `"croak "` means a frog is printing five letters `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'`, and `'k'` sequentially. The frogs have to print all five letters to finish a croak. If the given string is not a combination of a valid `"croak "` return `-1`.

Example 1:

Input: croakOfFrogs =  "croakcroak "
Output: 1 
Explanation: One frog yelling  "croak " twice.

Example 2:

Input: croakOfFrogs =  "crcoakroak "
Output: 2 
Explanation: The minimum number of frogs is two. 
The first frog could yell  "crcoakroak ".
The second frog could yell later  "crcoakroak ".

Example 3:

Input: croakOfFrogs =  "croakcrook "
Output: -1
Explanation: The given string is an invalid combination of  "croak " from different frogs.

Constraints:

   `1 <= croakOfFrogs.length <= 105`
   `croakOfFrogs` is either `'c'`, `'r'`, `'o'`, `'a'`, or `'k'`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem is to determine the minimum number of frogs needed to produce a given mixed sequence of the string "croak", where each frog can croak "croak" sequentially but multiple frogs can overlap in their croaking. If the sequence cannot be formed by a valid combination of "croak" strings, the function should return -1.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Initialization**: We need to keep track of the number of frogs at each stage of the croaking process. This can be done by initializing counters for each character ('c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k') to 0. Additionally, we need a variable to keep track of the total number of frogs and another variable to track the maximum number of frogs croaking simultaneously, which will be our final answer.

2. **Iterating Through the String**: We loop through each character of the given string `croakOfFrogs`. For each character, we perform the following actions based on the character:
   - **'c'**: This indicates the start of a new croak, so we increment the counter for 'c'. This might also mean we need a new frog, so we update our total frogs count and check if this is a new maximum of simultaneous frogs.
   - **'r'**, **'o'**, **'a'**: For these characters, we check if the count of the previous character in the "croak" sequence is greater than the count of the current character. If so, we decrement the count of the previous character and increment the count of the current character. This represents a frog moving on to the next character in the "croak" sequence.
   - **'k'**: Reaching 'k' means a frog has finished croaking. We decrement the count of 'a' and increment the count for 'k', effectively freeing a frog from the croaking sequence.

3. **Validation**: After processing all characters, we need to ensure that all counts (except for the total frogs) are back to 0. If any of the counters for 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', or 'k' (except the total frog count) is not 0, it means the sequence was invalid, and we return -1.

4. **Returning the Result**: If the input string is a valid combination of "croak" strings, we return the maximum number of frogs that were croaking simultaneously at any point in time. This is because even though a frog may finish croaking and start again, the peak simultaneous croaking gives us the minimum number of frogs needed.

### Relevant Information

- The sequence must follow the order 'c' → 'r' → 'o' → 'a' → 'k' for it to be valid.
- A frog can start a new "croak" only after it has finished the previous one.
- Multiple frogs can be at different stages of croaking at the same time.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of frogs needed, which equates to the maximum number of frogs croaking at any point in time if the sequence is valid.

### Conclusion

This approach allows us to simulate the croaking process while keeping track of the progression of each "croak" and ensuring the sequence's validity. By maintaining counters for each character in the "croak" sequence and updating the total and maximum number of frogs as we iterate through the input string, we can efficiently determine the minimum number of frogs needed or return -1 if the sequence is invalid.
