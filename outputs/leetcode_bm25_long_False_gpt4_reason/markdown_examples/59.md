# Query `59`

## Original Question

*Tic-tac-toe is played by two players `A` and `B` on a `3 x 3` grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

   Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
   The first player `A` always places `'X'` characters, while the second player `B` always places `'O'` characters.
   `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
   The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
   The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
   No more moves can be played if the game is over.

Given a 2D integer array `moves` where `moves[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the `ith` move will be played on `grid[rowi][coli]`. return _the winner of the game if it exists_ (`A` or `B`). In case the game ends in a draw return `"Draw "`. If there are still movements to play return `"Pending "`.

You can assume that `moves` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and `A` will play first.

Example 1:

Input: moves = \[\[0,0\],\[2,0\],\[1,1\],\[2,1\],\[2,2\]\]
Output:  "A "
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.

Example 2:

Input: moves = \[\[0,0\],\[1,1\],\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[1,0\],\[2,0\]\]
Output:  "B "
Explanation: B wins.

Example 3:

Input: moves = \[\[0,0\],\[1,1\],\[2,0\],\[1,0\],\[1,2\],\[2,1\],\[0,1\],\[0,2\],\[2,2\]\]
Output:  "Draw "
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.

Constraints:

   `1 <= moves.length <= 9`
   `moves[i].length == 2`
   `0 <= rowi, coli <= 2`
   There are no repeated elements on `moves`.
   `moves` follow the rules of tic tac toe.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the outcome of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe given a sequence of moves. We need to check if either player `A` or `B` has won the game, if the game is a draw, or if the game is still pending based on the moves made so far. To address this problem, let's break it down into steps and identify the relevant information:

1. **Representation of the Board:**
   - The board can be represented as a 2D array (3x3) initialized with empty spaces to indicate that no moves have been made yet.

2. **Tracking Moves:**
   - As players make moves, we update the board by placing `'X'` for player `A` and `'O'` for player `B` in the corresponding position `[row, col]` provided by the `moves` array.

3. **Determining the Current Player:**
   - Since player `A` always goes first and they alternate, we can determine the current player based on the index of the move. If it's even (0, 2, 4...), it's player `A`'s turn; if it's odd (1, 3, 5...), it's player `B`'s turn.

4. **Checking for a Win:**
   - After each move, check if there are three of the same symbols in any row, column, or diagonal. This can be done by comparing the symbols in all possible winning combinations.
   - There are 8 possible ways to win: 3 rows, 3 columns, and 2 diagonals. If any of these combinations have the same non-empty symbol, the corresponding player wins.

5. **Checking for a Draw:**
   - If all 9 squares are filled and there's no winner, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Checking for Pending Game:**
   - If there's no winner and not all squares are filled, the game is still pending.

**Solution Approach:**

- Initialize a 3x3 board.
- Iterate through the `moves` array, updating the board and alternating between players.
- After each move, check for a win condition:
  - If a win is detected, return the winner (`"A"` or `"B"`).
- After processing all moves, check if the board is full:
  - If full and no winner, return `"Draw"`.
  - If not full, return `"Pending"`.

**Pseudocode Example:**

```python
function ticTacToe(moves):
    board = [[None for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    for i, (row, col) in enumerate(moves):
        player = 'X' if i % 2 == 0 else 'O'
        board[row][col] = player
        if checkWin(player, board):
            return "A" if player == 'X' else "B"
    if len(moves) == 9:
        return "Draw"
    else:
        return "Pending"

function checkWin(player, board):
    # Check rows, columns, and diagonals for a win
    win_conditions = [
        # Rows
        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)],
        [(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)],
        [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)],
        # Columns
        [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)],
        [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1)],
        [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2)],
        # Diagonals
        [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)],
        [(0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0)]
    ]
    for condition in win_conditions:
        if all(board[row][col] == player for row, col in condition):
            return True
    return False
```

This approach and pseudocode outline the steps and logic needed to solve the given problem by identifying the winner, draw, or pending status of a Tic-Tac-Toe game based on a sequence of moves.
