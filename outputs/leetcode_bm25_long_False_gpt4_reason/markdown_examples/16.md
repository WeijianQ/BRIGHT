# Query `16`

## Original Question

*You are given a list of airline `tickets` where `tickets[i] = [fromi, toi]` represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it.

All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `"JFK "`, thus, the itinerary must begin with `"JFK "`. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.

   For example, the itinerary `[ "JFK ", "LGA "]` has a smaller lexical order than `[ "JFK ", "LGB "]`.

You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once.

Example 1:

Input: tickets = \[\[ "MUC ", "LHR "\],\[ "JFK ", "MUC "\],\[ "SFO ", "SJC "\],\[ "LHR ", "SFO "\]\]
Output: \[ "JFK ", "MUC ", "LHR ", "SFO ", "SJC "\]

Example 2:

Input: tickets = \[\[ "JFK ", "SFO "\],\[ "JFK ", "ATL "\],\[ "SFO ", "ATL "\],\[ "ATL ", "JFK "\],\[ "ATL ", "SFO "\]\]
Output: \[ "JFK ", "ATL ", "JFK ", "SFO ", "ATL ", "SFO "\]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is \[ "JFK ", "SFO ", "ATL ", "JFK ", "ATL ", "SFO "\] but it is larger in lexical order.

Constraints:

   `1 <= tickets.length <= 300`
   `tickets[i].length == 2`
   `fromi.length == 3`
   `toi.length == 3`
   `fromi` and `toi` consist of uppercase English letters.
   `fromi != toi`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to reconstruct an itinerary from a given list of airline tickets that forms a path starting from "JFK". The path must use all the tickets exactly once and follow the smallest lexical order when there are multiple valid itineraries from the same starting airport. This problem is a variant of the Eulerian path problem, which seeks to find a path through a graph that visits every edge exactly once. Here, the airports act as nodes, and the tickets represent directed edges between these nodes.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Graph Construction**: The first step is to construct a graph where each node represents an airport and each directed edge represents a flight from one airport to another. This graph is not necessarily symmetric, as there might be a flight from A to B but not necessarily from B to A.

2. **Sorting Edges**: For each node (airport), sort the outgoing edges (flights) in lexical order. This sorting ensures that when we are exploring the possible paths, we choose the path that is smallest in lexical order first.

3. **Finding the Itinerary**:
    - Start from the "JFK" node since the itinerary must begin with "JFK".
    - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse through the graph. The choice of DFS is critical because it allows us to explore a complete path from the starting node to the end before backtracking to explore another path.
    - As we visit each node, we remove the edge from the current node to the next node to ensure that each ticket is used exactly once.
    - If we reach a node with no outgoing edges (which means we cannot go any further), we add this node to our itinerary. This step might seem counterintuitive, but by doing this as we backtrack, we are effectively adding the nodes in reverse order of the path we are exploring.

4. **Backtracking and Constructing the Itinerary**:
    - Since the nodes are added in reverse order due to the nature of DFS and backtracking, we need to reverse the constructed itinerary at the end to get the correct order.
    - This reverse operation gives us the itinerary starting from "JFK" and following the smallest lexical order at each step.

### Additional Thoughts

- **Handling Cycles and Dead Ends**: One of the trickier parts of this problem is handling cycles and dead ends correctly. If we reach a dead end (other than the final destination), we need to backtrack and try a different path. This is naturally handled by the DFS approach as long as we keep track of visited edges.
- **Graph Representation**: An efficient way to represent the graph is using a hash map where the keys are the nodes (airports) and the values are lists (or priority queues) of outgoing edges (destinations) sorted in lexical order.
- **Edge Removal**: Carefully managing the removal of edges as they are used is crucial to ensure that each ticket is used exactly once. This can be efficiently done by removing the head of the list or queue representing the outgoing edges from each node as we traverse them.

This approach, combining graph construction, lexical sorting of edges, depth-first search, and careful management of edge removal, allows us to reconstruct the itinerary in the desired order, fulfilling the problem's constraints and requirements.
