# Query `128`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the inclusive interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more groups such that each interval is in exactly one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group intersect each other.

Return _the minimum number of groups you need to make_.

Two intervals intersect if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = \[\[5,10\],\[6,8\],\[1,5\],\[2,3\],\[1,10\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
- Group 1: \[1, 5\], \[6, 8\].
- Group 2: \[2, 3\], \[5, 10\].
- Group 3: \[1, 10\].
It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = \[\[1,3\],\[5,6\],\[8,10\],\[11,13\]\]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.

Constraints:

   `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
   `intervals[i].length == 2`
   `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 106`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum number of groups needed to organize a set of intervals so that no two intervals in the same group intersect. To tackle this problem, we need to understand the nature of interval overlaps and devise a strategy that minimizes the number of groups while ensuring that each interval is placed in exactly one group without any overlaps within the group.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Sorting Intervals**: The first step in organizing the intervals into groups is to sort them. A logical approach would be to sort the intervals based on their start points (`lefti`). However, for this specific problem, sorting based on either the start or the end points alone does not directly solve the issue of grouping without overlaps. What we need is a strategy that helps us understand the "depth" of overlap at any point in time.

2. **Using a Priority Queue**: Instead of merely sorting, we can use a more dynamic approach to handle overlaps as we iterate through the intervals. A priority queue (or min heap) that keeps track of the end points (`righti`) of the intervals in the current group can help us manage overlaps effectively. Here's how:
   - Sort the intervals by their start points.
   - Iterate through the sorted intervals, and for each interval, check if it overlaps with the interval having the earliest end point (the top of the priority queue).
   - If an interval does not overlap (i.e., its start point is greater than or equal to the end point of the earliest-ending interval in the priority queue), it means it can be part of the current group, so we replace the earliest-ending interval in the queue with the current interval.
   - If an interval does overlap, it signifies that a new group is needed (or, in the context of the priority queue, the interval simply gets added to the queue without removing any), which effectively increases the "depth" of overlapping intervals at that point.

3. **Counting Groups**: The number of groups needed corresponds to the maximum size reached by the priority queue during this process. This is because the size of the queue at any point reflects the maximum number of overlapping intervals seen so far, which directly translates to the minimum number of groups needed to accommodate those intervals without overlaps.

### Implementation Overview:

- Sort the intervals by their start points.
- Initialize a priority queue to keep track of the end points of intervals in a group.
- Iterate through the sorted intervals:
  - For each interval, if the start is greater than or equal to the minimum end point in the queue, pop the minimum from the queue (as this interval does not overlap with the current one).
  - Add the current interval's end point to the queue.
- The size of the priority queue at the end (or the maximum size it reaches) represents the minimum number of groups needed.

### Conclusion:

By strategically using a priority queue to manage overlaps, we can dynamically organize intervals into groups, ensuring no overlaps within a group and minimizing the number of groups needed. This approach efficiently handles the complexity of interval overlaps and provides a scalable solution for the given problem.

You will then<br>            need to post-process the detections (which should be done anyway<br>            to remove duplicates).
