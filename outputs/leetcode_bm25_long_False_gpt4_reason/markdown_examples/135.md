# Query `135`

## Original Question

*You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return _the minimum possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.

Note:

   A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
   It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
   The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between `1` and `n`.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, roads = \[\[1,2,9\],\[2,3,6\],\[2,4,5\],\[1,4,7\]\]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, roads = \[\[1,2,2\],\[1,3,4\],\[3,4,7\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= roads.length <= 105`
   `roads[i].length == 3`
   `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
   `ai != bi`
   `1 <= distancei <= 104`
   There are no repeated edges.
   There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n, where the score of a path is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path. This problem can be approached by analyzing the given conditions and constraints, and applying graph theory concepts.

### Relevant Information and Thoughts

1. **Graph Representation**: The cities and roads can be represented as a graph, where cities are nodes and roads are edges connecting these nodes. Since the roads are bidirectional, the graph is undirected.

2. **Score of a Path**: The unique aspect of this problem is how the score of a path is determined. Unlike traditional pathfinding problems where the goal is to minimize the total distance, here the goal is to maximize the minimum road distance in the path from city 1 to city n. This means we are looking for a path that ensures the smallest road in our path is as large as possible.

3. **Approach**: A straightforward approach like Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths won't work directly because the problem isn't asking for the shortest total distance, but rather a path optimization based on the minimum road distance encountered in the path. However, a modified version of Dijkstra's or a Binary Search combined with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) might be useful.

### Step by Step Approach

1. **Binary Search on Distance**: Since we are looking for the minimum possible score (minimum road distance on the optimal path), we can perform a binary search on the possible scores (distances). The search space is from `1` to `max_distance` among all roads. For each potential score (midpoint in binary search), we check if there exists a path from city 1 to city n that does not include any road with a distance less than this score.

2. **Checking Path Existence**: To check if a valid path exists for a given minimum road distance, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like BFS or DFS. We temporarily ignore roads that have a distance less than the current score we are testing. If we can reach city n from city 1 under these conditions, the path is valid for the current score.

3. **Optimization**: Each time a valid path is found, it means we can try to increase the score (since we're looking for the minimum possible maximum road distance). If no valid path exists, we need to decrease the score. This process continues until the binary search converges to a solution.

### Draft Answer

To solve the problem, we first represent the cities and roads as a graph. Then, we perform a binary search on the possible scores, which are the road distances. For each score tested, we use a graph traversal algorithm (BFS or DFS) to check if a valid path exists from city 1 to city n, ignoring roads with distances below the current score. This approach ensures that we are always trying to maximize the minimum road distance on our path, aligning with the problem's objective.

This problem requires a blend of understanding graph theory, binary search for optimization, and effective graph traversal techniques to check for path existence under varying conditions. The final solution iteratively refines the minimum score until the optimal path is identified, balancing the constraints and ensuring that the approach is efficient for large input sizes as specified in the constraints.
