# Query `24`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

Example 1:

Input: nums = \[1,5,2\]
Output: false
Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

Example 2:

Input: nums = \[1,5,233,7\]
Output: true
Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

Constraints:

   `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
   `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is a dynamic programming (DP) problem, where we need to determine if Player 1 can win given the optimal plays from both players. The core idea revolves around maximizing the player's score while minimizing the opponent's score, considering that each player can choose a number from either end of the array.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The decision made at each step affects the outcome of the game. We need to consider every possible choice (i.e., taking from the left or the right end of the array) and its impact on the future state of the game.

2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: As we break down the problem into smaller problems, we'll notice that we are solving the same problems multiple times. For example, after the first choice, no matter what is chosen, the subarray from which the next player chooses is a smaller instance of the original problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score Player 1 can achieve over Player 2 when the array left to be considered is from index `i` to `j`. Since both players play optimally, we need to consider that Player 2 will try to minimize Player 1's score in their turn.

4. **Game Theory**: At each step, a player will choose the option that maximizes their advantage (or minimizes their disadvantage). This means considering the future implications of each current choice.

### Solving the Problem:

1. **Initialization**: Create a 2D DP array with dimensions equal to the length of `nums`. Each cell `dp[i][j]` starts with a value of 0, indicating that when there are no numbers to choose (i.e., when `i > j`), the maximum score difference is 0.

2. **Bottom-Up Approach**: Fill the DP table starting from the base cases where the subarray length is 1 (i.e., `i == j`). In this case, `dp[i][i] = nums[i]` because if there's only one number to choose, Player 1 will take it, and the score difference is just that number.

3. **Filling the DP Table**: For subarrays of length greater than 1, calculate `dp[i][j]` considering two scenarios:
   - Player 1 takes the `i`th number, then Player 2 plays optimally for the subarray `i+1` to `j`. The score difference is `nums[i] - dp[i+1][j]`.
   - Player 1 takes the `j`th number, then Player 2 plays optimally for the subarray `i` to `j-1`. The score difference is `nums[j] - dp[i][j-1]`.
   The maximum of these two choices will be the value of `dp[i][j]`, representing the best score difference Player 1 can achieve against Player 2 from this subarray.

4. **Result**: After filling the DP table, check `dp[0][nums.length - 1]`. If this value is greater than or equal to 0, it means Player 1 can win or tie the game (since a non-negative score difference indicates Player 1 has scored equal to or more than Player 2), hence return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach ensures that we consider every possible game state and the optimal decisions at each point, leading to a comprehensive solution to whether Player 1 can win.
