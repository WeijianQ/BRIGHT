# Query `29`

## Original Question

*There is a robot starting at the position `(0, 0)`, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at `(0, 0)` after it completes its moves.

You are given a string `moves` that represents the move sequence of the robot where `moves[i]` represents its `ith` move. Valid moves are `'R'` (right), `'L'` (left), `'U'` (up), and `'D'` (down).

Return `true` _if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing " is irrelevant. `'R'` will always make the robot move to the right once, `'L'` will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

Example 1:

Input: moves =  "UD "
Output: true
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.

Example 2:

Input: moves =  "LL "
Output: false
Explanation: The robot moves left twice. It ends up two  "moves " to the left of the origin. We return false because it is not at the origin at the end of its moves.

Constraints:

   `1 <= moves.length <= 2  104`
   `moves` only contains the characters `'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'` and `'R'`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine whether a sequence of moves (each represented by a letter that corresponds to a direction) brings a robot back to its starting point, `(0, 0)`, on a 2D plane. To solve this problem, we need to translate the sequence of moves into a set of coordinate changes and then check if the final coordinates are equal to the starting point.

### Relevant Information:
1. **Directional Moves:** Each move corresponds to a direction - 'R' (right), 'L' (left), 'U' (up), and 'D' (down). We can associate each of these with a change in the x or y coordinates:
   - 'R': Increase x by 1.
   - 'L': Decrease x by 1.
   - 'U': Increase y by 1.
   - 'D': Decrease y by 1.
   
2. **Magnitude of Movement:** The problem statement clarifies that all moves have the same magnitude, which simplifies our calculation since we can consider each move as a unit step in its respective direction.

3. **Final Position Check:** To determine if the robot returns to the origin, we need to check if, after all moves have been applied, the x and y coordinates are both 0.

### Step by Step Solution:
1. **Initialize Coordinates:** Start with initial coordinates `(x, y) = (0, 0)`.

2. **Translate Moves into Coordinates:**
   - Loop through each character in the `moves` string.
   - For each character, update the `(x, y)` coordinates based on the direction it represents.

3. **Check Final Position:**
   - After processing all moves, check if `(x, y) == (0, 0)`.
   - If true, the robot returns to the origin, and we return `true`.
   - If false, the robot does not return to the origin, and we return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Example 1:** For `moves = "UD"`, we process each move:
  - 'U': `(x, y)` changes from `(0, 0)` to `(0, 1)`.
  - 'D': `(x, y)` changes back from `(0, 1)` to `(0, 0)`.
  - Final position is `(0, 0)`, so we return `true`.
  
- **Example 2:** For `moves = "LL"`, we process each move:
  - 'L': `(x, y)` changes from `(0, 0)` to `(-1, 0)`.
  - 'L' again: `(x, y)` changes from `(-1, 0)` to `(-2, 0)`.
  - Final position is `(-2, 0)`, not `(0, 0)`, so we return `false`.

### Conclusion:
This approach effectively translates a sequence of directional moves into coordinate changes on a 2D plane and assesses whether these moves lead the robot back to its starting point. By keeping track of the cumulative effect of these moves on the robot's position, we can accurately determine whether it returns to the origin or not.
