# Query `115`

## Original Question

*You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return _the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._

Example 1:

Input: parent = \[-1,0,0,1,1,2\], s =  "abacbe "
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. 

Example 2:

Input: parent = \[-1,0,0,0\], s =  "aabc "
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.

Constraints:

   `n == parent.length == s.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
   `parent[0] == -1`
   `parent` represents a valid tree.
   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the longest path in a given tree where no two adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them. To address this, we need to consider the structure of the tree, the relationships between nodes (parent-child relationships), and the characters assigned to each node. 

### Step 1: Represent the Tree

First, we need to construct the tree from the given `parent` array. Since the tree is rooted at node `0`, and we have the parent of each node, we can represent the tree as an adjacency list. This involves creating a list (or dictionary, depending on the programming language) where each key is a node, and its value is a list of its children. This representation allows us to traverse the tree efficiently.

### Step 2: Traverse the Tree

To find the longest path where no two adjacent nodes have the same character, we can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the root. The DFS will help us explore each possible path from the root to the leaves. However, the challenge here is to keep track of the longest path length while ensuring that adjacent nodes on the path have different characters.

### Step 3: Track the Longest Path

During the DFS, we can maintain two pieces of information for each node: the longest path length when this node is the ending node, and the characters along the path. However, storing all characters along the path is inefficient. Instead, we can track the length of the path dynamically and compare the character of the current node with its parent to decide whether to continue the path or start a new one.

To implement this, for each node, we will:
- Compare its character with its parent's character.
- If they are different, we continue the path by incrementing the path length.
- If they are the same, we reset the path length for this branch.
- Keep track of the maximum path length encountered during the traversal.

### Step 4: Edge Cases and Optimization

We need to consider some edge cases, such as when the tree has a single node or when all nodes have the same character. In these cases, the longest path would be 1.

For optimization, note that in a tree, the longest path (also known as the diameter) could either pass through the root or not. However, since our problem has the additional constraint of differing adjacent characters, we focus on maximizing the length while adhering to this constraint, making the problem unique compared to finding a tree's diameter.

### Conclusion

By constructing the tree, performing a DFS traversal, and carefully tracking the path length while adhering to the character constraint, we can find the length of the longest path that meets the criteria. This approach ensures that we consider each node and its character, allowing us to accurately determine the longest valid path in the tree.
