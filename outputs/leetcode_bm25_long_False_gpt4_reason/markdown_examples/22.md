# Query `22`

## Original Question

*In the "100 game " two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play optimally.

Example 1:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.

Example 2:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true

Constraints:

   `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
   `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine if the first player can guarantee a win by making optimal choices, given the constraints of choosing integers from 1 to `maxChoosableInteger` without replacement until the sum of chosen integers reaches or exceeds the `desiredTotal`. The challenge is compounded by the fact that both players are assumed to play optimally, meaning they will make the best possible move available to them at each turn.

### Key Considerations:

1. **Sum of All Numbers**: The sum of integers from 1 to `maxChoosableInteger` can be calculated using the formula `n(n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is `maxChoosableInteger`. This sum is crucial because if it is less than the `desiredTotal`, the first player cannot win under any strategy since it's impossible to reach the `desiredTotal`.

2. **Optimal Play**: Both players are assumed to make the best moves possible. This implies a strategic depth to the game, where each player must consider not just the immediate impact of their move but also how it affects future moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Given the game's constraints and the need for optimal play, a dynamic programming approach can be helpful. By memorizing states (combinations of available numbers and the current total), we can avoid recalculating outcomes for known situations, thereby optimizing the decision-making process.

### Step by Step Analysis:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `desiredTotal` <= 0, the first player wins by default since the condition is already met before the game starts.
   - If the sum of all choosable integers is less than `desiredTotal`, the first player cannot win.

2. **Recursive Solution**:
   - At any point in the game, the current player's goal is to make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position. This involves choosing a number that, when added to the current total, either reaches the `desiredTotal` (winning immediately) or forces the opponent into a situation where no matter what they choose, they cannot win in their next turn.
   - A memoization table is necessary to store the outcomes of different states (combinations of chosen numbers and the current total) to avoid recalculating them.

3. **Winning Strategy**:
   - For the first player to guarantee a win, they must be able to make a move that either wins the game directly or ensures that no matter what the second player does, the second player is left in a losing position. This might involve choosing numbers that limit the second player's options or strategically leaving certain numbers available to ensure victory.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1 (maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11)**:
  - The first player cannot win because whatever number they choose, the second player can always choose a number that makes the total reach or exceed 11. This is a straightforward case where the sum of the numbers and the desired total dictate the outcome directly.

- **Example 2 (maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0)**:
  - The first player wins by default since the desired total is 0 or less, meaning the winning condition is met before the game starts.

- **Example 3 (maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1)**:
  - The first player can choose 1 and immediately win since the desired total is reached with the first move.

### Conclusion:

To determine if the first player can force a win, one must analyze the game's state space optimally and use dynamic programming to remember the outcomes of different game states. This problem requires careful consideration of the sum of available numbers, the desired total, and the strategic implications of each player's moves.
