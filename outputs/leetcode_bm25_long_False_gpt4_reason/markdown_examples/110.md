# Query `110`

## Original Question

*You are given an array of positive integers `beans`, where each integer represents the number of magic beans found in a particular magic bag.

Remove any number of beans (possibly none) from each bag such that the number of beans in each remaining non-empty bag (still containing at least one bean) is equal. Once a bean has been removed from a bag, you are not allowed to return it to any of the bags.

Return _the minimum number of magic beans that you have to remove_.

Example 1:

Input: beans = \[4,1,6,5\]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
- We remove 1 bean from the bag with only 1 bean.
  This results in the remaining bags: \[4,0,6,5\]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the bag with 6 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: \[4,0,4,5\]
- Then we remove 1 bean from the bag with 5 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: \[4,0,4,4\]
We removed a total of 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
There are no other solutions that remove 4 beans or fewer.

Example 2:

Input: beans = \[2,10,3,2\]
Output: 7
Explanation:
- We remove 2 beans from one of the bags with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: \[0,10,3,2\]
- Then we remove 2 beans from the other bag with 2 beans.
  This results in the remaining bags: \[0,10,3,0\]
- Then we remove 3 beans from the bag with 3 beans. 
  This results in the remaining bags: \[0,10,0,0\]
We removed a total of 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 beans to make the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans.
There are no other solutions that removes 7 beans or fewer.

Constraints:

   `1 <= beans.length <= 105`
   `1 <= beans[i] <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum number of beans that need to be removed from the bags so that all the remaining non-empty bags have an equal number of beans. This problem involves optimization and requires a strategy that minimizes the total number of beans removed while achieving the goal of equalizing the number of beans in the remaining non-empty bags.

To approach this problem, let's consider the following steps and pieces of information that could be relevant and helpful:

### 1. Sort the Array
First, we sort the array of beans in non-decreasing order. Sorting helps us understand the distribution of beans across the bags and makes it easier to determine which bags to remove beans from and how many to remove.

### 2. Calculate Total Beans
Calculate the total number of beans present across all bags initially. This total gives us a starting point for understanding the maximum number of beans we could potentially remove.

### 3. Consider Each Unique Bean Count as a Potential Final Count
After sorting, we should consider each unique bean count in the array as a potential final count for the remaining non-empty bags. This is because the optimal solution could involve equalizing the beans to any of the counts present in the array, depending on the distribution of the beans.

### 4. Compute Beans to Remove for Each Potential Final Count
For each potential final count (starting from the smallest non-zero bean count to the largest), compute the total number of beans that need to be removed to make all remaining non-empty bags have that count. This involves:

- Ignoring all bags with a bean count less than the current potential final count since those would be emptied.
- For each bag with a bean count greater than the current potential final count, calculate the difference between its bean count and the potential final count. Sum these differences.
- Keep track of the minimum number of beans removed encountered so far.

### 5. Adjust for Bags Removed
As we consider each potential final count, we should also adjust our calculation based on the fact that some bags might be completely emptied and thus removed from consideration. This adjustment is crucial for ensuring we're only considering non-empty bags in our final count.

### 6. Find the Minimum Beans Removed
After iterating through all potential final counts, the minimum number of beans removed encountered during these calculations is the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion
This approach ensures we consider every possible scenario for equalizing the beans while minimizing the total number removed. It leverages sorting to simplify the problem and iterates through potential solutions in an efficient manner. By calculating the beans to be removed for each potential final count and adjusting for emptied bags, we can find the optimal solution that meets the problem's requirements.
