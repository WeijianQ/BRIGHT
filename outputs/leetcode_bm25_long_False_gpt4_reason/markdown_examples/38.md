# Query `38`

## Original Question

*There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `ith` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return _the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side_. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

Example 1:

Input: row = \[0,2,1,3\]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row\[1\]) and third (row\[2\]) person.

Example 2:

Input: row = \[3,2,0,1\]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.

Constraints:

   `2n == row.length`
   `2 <= n <= 30`
   `n` is even.
   `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
   All the elements of `row` are unique.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the minimum number of swaps required to arrange couples (who are initially sitting in a disordered manner) side by side in a row of seats. Each couple is identified by consecutive numbers, and the arrangement is represented by an integer array where each element corresponds to a person's ID sitting in that position.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Couples' Identification**: Since couples are numbered in order, for any person with an ID `x`, their partner's ID can be easily identified. If `x` is even, their partner's ID is `x + 1`, and if `x` is odd, their partner's ID is `x - 1`. This helps in identifying which two people need to be sitting together.
2. **Optimal Swaps**: The goal is to minimize the number of swaps. A direct swap that places a couple together is always preferable. However, it may involve rearranging others who are not part of the swap.
3. **Greedy Approach**: In most scenarios involving minimizing swaps or moves, a greedy strategy where we fix one pair at a time often leads to an optimal solution. Here, we can iterate through the array, and for each person, we find their partner and swap the person next to them with their partner if they are not already sitting together.
4. **Tracking Swaps and Positions**: It's essential to keep track of who is sitting where after each swap to efficiently find partners and perform the next swap without redoing any previous work.

### Step by Step Solution:
1. **Iterate Through the Row**: Start by iterating through the array from the first to the last seat, but only checking the even positions (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2) since we are dealing with couples and considering two seats at a time.
2. **Check If Couples Are Sitting Together**: For each position `i` checked, calculate the partner's ID of the person sitting in `i`. If the person in position `i+1` is not the partner, a swap is needed.
3. **Find the Partner and Swap**: Locate the partner of the person at `i` in the array, which could be done with a linear search from `i+1` onwards or by using a more efficient data structure like a hash map to track positions. Once found, swap the partner with the person currently sitting in seat `i+1`.
4. **Count and Perform Swaps**: Perform the swap and increment your swap count. Keep track of any changes in the positions of individuals in your auxiliary data structure if used.
5. **Repeat Until Organized**: Continue this process for each couple (every even index). The total count of swaps will be the answer.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case if a linear search is used for finding partners for each person. This can be reduced to O(n) if a hash map is used to track the current positions of each person, as each swap and search operation would then take constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the hash map used to track positions if this optimization is applied.

### Conclusion:
This problem is a classic example of applying a greedy strategy to minimize swaps. By methodically pairing each couple starting from the beginning of the array and efficiently tracking positions, we can calculate the minimum number of swaps required to seat all couples together.
