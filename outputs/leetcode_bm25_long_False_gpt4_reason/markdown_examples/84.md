# Query `84`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The population of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the inclusive range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.

Return _the earliest year with the maximum population_.

Example 1:

Input: logs = \[\[1993,1999\],\[2000,2010\]\]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

Example 2:

Input: logs = \[\[1950,1961\],\[1960,1971\],\[1970,1981\]\]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.

Constraints:

   `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
   `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`*

The essential problem here is to find the year with the highest population, based on birth and death years data for multiple individuals, and if there are multiple such years, to return the earliest one. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem, along with the relevant information and reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Data Structure**: The input is a 2D array `logs` where each element is another array `[birthi, deathi]` representing the birth and death years of the ith person. It's important to note that a person is considered alive in the inclusive range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`, meaning they are not counted as alive in their death year.

2. **Population Counting Logic**: For any given year `x`, to determine if a person is alive, we check if `x` falls in the range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. To find the year with the maximum population, we need to count the population for each year in the range of all given birth and death years and then find the year with the highest count.

3. **Data Preparation**: 
   - **Year Range Identification**: First, find the minimum and maximum years mentioned in the logs to establish the range of years we need to consider. This could potentially reduce the number of years we need to examine, especially if the years span a narrower range than 1950 to 2050.
   - **Population Changes Tracking**: An efficient way to solve this problem is to track the changes in population rather than counting the population each year. This can be done by incrementing the population for the birth year and decrementing it for the death year (since the person is not alive in the death year, according to the problem statement).

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a map or array (let's call it `yearChanges`) to keep track of population changes for each year.
   - Iterate through each `[birthi, deathi]` in `logs` and for each:
     - Increment the population in `yearChanges` for `birthi`.
     - Decrement the population in `yearChanges` for `deathi` (since the person dies and is not counted for this year and onwards).
   - Now, iterate through the years from the earliest birth year to the latest death year (or 2050, whichever is earlier), keeping a running total of the population based on the increments and decrements recorded in `yearChanges`.
   - While doing so, track the year with the highest population. If a year has the same population as the maximum found so far but is earlier, update the year of the maximum population.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the years, the year with the highest population recorded so far is the answer.

**Example Application**: 
- For the example `[[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]`, we increment the population for years 1950, 1960, and 1970, and decrement for 1961, 1971, and 1981. 
- Tracking these changes across years, we find that the population increases in 1950, increases again in 1960, doesn't change in 1970 (as one person dies and another is born), and starts to decrease from 1961 onwards each time a person dies. 
- The maximum population is found to be in 1960, making it the answer.

This approach efficiently finds the earliest year with the maximum population by leveraging the idea of tracking population changes rather than counting the population afresh each year.
