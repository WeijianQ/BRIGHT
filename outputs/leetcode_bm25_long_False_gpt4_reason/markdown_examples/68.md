# Query `68`

## Original Question

*Given a wooden stick of length `n` units. The stick is labelled from `0` to `n`. For example, a stick of length 6 is labelled as follows:

Given an integer array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position you should perform a cut at.

You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.

Return _the minimum total cost_ of the cuts.

Example 1:

Input: n = 7, cuts = \[1,3,4,5\]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = \[1, 3, 4, 5\] as in the input leads to the following scenario:
 
The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be \[3, 5, 1, 4\] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

Example 2:

Input: n = 9, cuts = \[5,6,1,4,2\]
Output: 22
Explanation: If you try the given cuts ordering the cost will be 25.
There are much ordering with total cost <= 25, for example, the order \[4, 6, 5, 2, 1\] has total cost = 22 which is the minimum possible.

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 106`
   `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n - 1, 100)`
   `1 <= cuts[i] <= n - 1`
   All the integers in `cuts` array are distinct.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum total cost of making cuts on a stick of length `n`, given a set of specific positions (`cuts`) at which the cuts must be made. The cost of each cut is equal to the length of the stick being cut at that time. Since the order of cuts can significantly affect the total cost, the challenge lies in determining the optimal sequence of cuts to minimize the overall cost.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use the results of solved subproblems to construct the solution for larger problems.

2. **Including Start and End Points**: To simplify the problem, it's helpful to include the start (0) and end (n) points of the stick in the `cuts` array. This way, we can consider the whole stick as segments between these cuts, including the edges.

3. **Sorting the Cuts**: Initially, sorting the `cuts` array (after including 0 and n) is essential. This arrangement helps in systematically exploring the possible cuts and their costs in a structured manner.

4. **Subproblem Definition**: A subproblem can be defined as finding the minimum cost to cut a portion of the stick defined by two endpoints. These endpoints could initially be 0 and n, and then they become the positions of the cuts as we proceed.

5. **DP State Representation**: We can represent the DP state with a 2D array `dp[i][j]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost of making all necessary cuts between the `i-th` and `j-th` cut positions in the sorted `cuts` array.

6. **DP Formula**: To fill the DP table, we iterate through all segments defined by pairs of cuts and for each segment, we try making each possible cut as the first cut in that segment. The cost of making a cut is the length of the segment (difference between the `j-th` and `i-th` positions) plus the minimum costs of cutting the left and right remaining segments. Formally, if `k` is the position of the cut we are considering within a segment defined by `i` and `j`, then:

   \[
   dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i][j], \text{length of the segment} + dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])
   \]

   where the length of the segment is `cuts[j] - cuts[i]`, and we iterate `k` through all possible cut positions between `i` and `j`.

7. **Initialization and Iteration**: The DP array is initialized with 0s, as the cost of cutting a segment without any cuts is 0. We then fill the DP table by increasing the length of the segments we are considering, ensuring that we have solved all smaller segments before attempting to solve larger ones.

8. **Answer Retrieval**: The answer to the problem, the minimum total cost, will be found in `dp[0][cuts.length - 1]` after including 0 and n in the cuts and sorting, since this represents the minimum cost to cut the entire stick.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. Add 0 and n to the `cuts` array and sort it.
2. Initialize a DP table of size `(cuts.length) x (cuts.length)` with all values set to infinity (or a large number) except the diagonal, which should be 0s (since the cost to cut a segment without any cuts is 0).
3. Fill the DP table using the formula described above, iterating through segments of increasing length.
4. Retrieve the final answer from `dp[0][cuts.length - 1]`.

This approach ensures that we are building up the solution from the simplest scenarios (no cuts or one cut) to the full problem, leveraging the results of smaller problems to solve larger ones, which is the essence of dynamic programming.
