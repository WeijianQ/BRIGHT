# Query `17`

## Original Question

*We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

   `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
   `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
   `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return _the number that I picked_.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
   `1 <= pick <= n`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to implement a binary search algorithm to efficiently find a hidden number within a defined range (from 1 to n) by making guesses and receiving feedback on whether each guess is higher, lower, or equal to the target number. This classic search problem leverages the concept of narrowing down the search space based on the feedback received, making it a practical application of binary search.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: Start with two variables, `low` and `high`, representing the current bounds of our search space. Initially, `low` is 1, and `high` is `n`, as the target number is somewhere between 1 and n.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, perform the following steps to progressively narrow down the search space:
     - Calculate the middle of the current search space (`mid`) as the average of `low` and `high`. This is where we make our guess.
     - Use the `guess(int num)` API on `mid`. The API will return:
       - `0` if `mid` equals the target number, meaning we've found our answer.
       - `-1` if `mid` is higher than the target, meaning we need to search the lower half of the current search space. We do this by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
       - `1` if `mid` is lower than the target, meaning we need to search the upper half of the current search space. We do this by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Termination**: The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, at which point we should have found the target number when the `guess` function returns `0`. The algorithm returns the `mid` value that caused `guess` to return `0`, which is the target number.

### Relevant Information:

- **Efficiency**: Binary search is efficient for this problem because it halves the search space with each guess, leading to a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the range.
- **Edge Cases**: Handling the case when `n` is 1 is trivial; our initial guess would be the only possible number. However, this scenario is naturally covered by the binary search logic.
- **API Constraints**: It's important to correctly interpret the API's return values to adjust the search bounds (`low` and `high`) accordingly.

### Draft Answer:

To solve the "Guess Game" problem, we implement a binary search algorithm. Initialize two pointers, `low` = 1 and `high` = `n`, to represent the bounds of our search space. We then enter a loop where we continually narrow our search space based on feedback from the `guess(int num)` API. We calculate the midpoint of our current search space and use it as our guess. If the guess is too high, we adjust our `high` bound; if too low, we adjust our `low` bound. If the guess is correct, we exit the loop and return the guessed number. This method efficiently finds the hidden number with a minimal number of guesses by leveraging the binary search strategy, offering a time complexity of O(log n).
