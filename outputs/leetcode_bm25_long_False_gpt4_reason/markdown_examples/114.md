# Query `114`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a positive integer.

A cornered path is defined as a set of adjacent cells with at most one turn. More specifically, the path should exclusively move either horizontally or vertically up to the turn (if there is one), without returning to a previously visited cell. After the turn, the path will then move exclusively in the alternate direction: move vertically if it moved horizontally, and vice versa, also without returning to a previously visited cell.

The product of a path is defined as the product of all the values in the path.

Return _the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path found in_ `grid`.

Note:

   Horizontal movement means moving in either the left or right direction.
   Vertical movement means moving in either the up or down direction.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[23,17,15,3,20\],\[8,1,20,27,11\],\[9,4,6,2,21\],\[40,9,1,10,6\],\[22,7,4,5,3\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation: The grid on the left shows a valid cornered path.
It has a product of 15 \ 20 \ 6 \ 1 \ 10 = 18000 which has 3 trailing zeros.
It can be shown that this is the maximum trailing zeros in the product of a cornered path.

The grid in the middle is not a cornered path as it has more than one turn.
The grid on the right is not a cornered path as it requires a return to a previously visited cell.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[4,3,2\],\[7,6,1\],\[8,8,8\]\]
Output: 0
Explanation: The grid is shown in the figure above.
There are no cornered paths in the grid that result in a product with a trailing zero.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
   `1 <= m  n <= 105`
   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the maximum number of trailing zeros in the product of any "cornered path" within a given 2D grid, following the constraints and definitions provided. To solve this, let's break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts:

### Understanding the Problem:

1. **Trailing Zeros in a Product:** The number of trailing zeros in a product is determined by the number of times the product can be divided by 10. Since 10 = 2 * 5, the problem essentially boils down to counting the factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of the product. The minimum of these counts gives the number of trailing zeros (since you need both a 2 and a 5 to make a 10).

2. **Cornered Paths:** These are paths in the grid that move either horizontally or vertically and may take at most one turn. After the turn, the path must change direction (from horizontal to vertical or vice versa) without revisiting any cell.

### Strategy:

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a brute-force approach (trying every possible path) is not feasible for large grids due to the exponential number of paths. Therefore, a more sophisticated method is required.

1. **Preprocessing Grid:** Compute and store the cumulative count of factors of 2 and 5 for each cell in four directions: rightward, downward, leftward, and upward. This step is crucial for quickly calculating the factors of 2 and 5 for any segment of a cornered path.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) or Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization:** These approaches might be considered for exploring all possible cornered paths efficiently. However, given the specific structure of the problem (the paths are straight lines with at most one corner), a direct computation based on the preprocessed information might be more efficient.

3. **Calculating Trailing Zeros for Cornered Paths:** For each cell in the grid that could serve as a corner (turning point) of the path, calculate the product of the path leading to it from one direction and then away from it in the perpendicular direction. Use the preprocessed counts of factors of 2 and 5 to do this calculation efficiently. The path with the maximum number of trailing zeros can be determined by taking the minimum of the counts of 2's and 5's in its prime factorization.

### Relevant Information:

- The counts of factors of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of each grid cell's value.
- The cumulative counts of these factors in each direction up to each cell, which allows for the quick calculation of the factors in any segment of a potential path.

### Drafting the Solution:

1. **Preprocess the Grid:** Calculate the cumulative counts of factors of 2 and 5 for each cell in all four directions. This preprocessing step is vital for efficiently calculating the factors for any path segment later on.

2. **Explore Cornered Paths:** For each cell, consider it as a potential corner and calculate the number of trailing zeros for paths that turn at this cell. This involves combining paths from two perpendicular directions (e.g., left and down, up and right, etc.).

3. **Maximize Trailing Zeros:** Keep track of the maximum number of trailing zeros found across all examined paths. This requires comparing the minimum of the cumulative counts of 2's and 5's for the segments that form each cornered path.

4. **Return the Maximum:** After examining all possible cornered paths, return the maximum number of trailing zeros found.

### Conclusion:

This approach leverages precomputation and efficient path evaluation to solve the problem within the given constraints. It's a blend of mathematical insight (into trailing zeros) and algorithmic strategy (for handling the grid and paths efficiently).
