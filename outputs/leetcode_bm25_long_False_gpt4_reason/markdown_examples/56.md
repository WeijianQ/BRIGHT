# Query `56`

## Original Question

*There are some stones in different positions on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `stones`, the positions of the stones.

Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position. In one move, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.

   In particular, if the stones are at say, `stones = [1,2,5]`, you cannot move the endpoint stone at position `5`, since moving it to any position (such as `0`, or `3`) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.

The game ends when you cannot make any more moves (i.e., the stones are in three consecutive positions).

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _of length_ `2` _where_:

   `answer[0]` _is the minimum number of moves you can play, and_
   `answer[1]` _is the maximum number of moves you can play_.

Example 1:

Input: stones = \[7,4,9\]
Output: \[1,2\]
Explanation: We can move 4 -> 8 for one move to finish the game.
Or, we can move 9 -> 5, 4 -> 6 for two moves to finish the game.

Example 2:

Input: stones = \[6,5,4,3,10\]
Output: \[2,3\]
Explanation: We can move 3 -> 8 then 10 -> 7 to finish the game.
Or, we can move 3 -> 7, 4 -> 8, 5 -> 9 to finish the game.
Notice we cannot move 10 -> 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.

Constraints:

   `3 <= stones.length <= 104`
   `1 <= stones[i] <= 109`
   All the values of `stones` are unique.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
To solve this problem, we must understand the task of moving stones such that they occupy three consecutive positions on the X-axis, while only moving endpoint stones and ensuring they are no longer endpoint stones after the move. We need to find both the minimum and maximum number of moves to achieve this configuration.

### 1. Essential Problem
The core of the problem lies in repositioning stones so they are in consecutive positions with the least and most number of moves, considering only endpoint stones can be moved in a manner that they should not remain endpoint stones after the move.

### 2. Strategy and Relevant Information

#### Minimum Moves:
For the minimum moves, the key is to see if we can achieve the configuration in one or two moves. This can happen in two cases:
- **Case 1:** If there's a gap of two positions anywhere between the stones, we can move one endpoint stone to fill this gap and possibly achieve the configuration in one move.
- **Case 2:** If not, we might need two moves, considering we can move one endpoint stone closer and then the other to fill any small gaps left.

An efficient way to calculate this is by considering the gaps between the sorted positions of stones and seeing if a sequence of three consecutive positions can fit within these gaps with at most one or two moves.

#### Maximum Moves:
The maximum number of moves is influenced by the larger gaps in the stones' positions. Essentially, it involves moving the endpoint stones towards the center, one position at a time, until they are in consecutive positions. This count is generally the total gap between the first and last stones minus the number of stones plus 1 (for the final consecutive position) but can be nuanced based on specific positions of stones.

#### Special Considerations:
- **Sliding Window:** A sliding window of size 3 (for the three consecutive positions) can help identify the minimum moves efficiently by checking the number of stones within any window of size equal to the span of three consecutive positions and how many moves are needed to get all stones within such a window.
- **Endpoints:** For calculating maximum moves, consider the largest gap from either end towards the center, discounting the direct moves that make a stone an endpoint again.

### 3. Draft Answer

First, sort the `stones` array to deal with stones in a sequential manner. This simplifies identifying the gaps between stones and the endpoints.

**Minimum Moves:**
- Utilize a sliding window approach to find the minimum moves needed. Move the window across the sorted stones to find a position where you can fit three stones with the least moves. Special attention is needed for the case where two stones are next to each other, and the third one is far away; this might still require two moves.
- Check for cases where you can achieve the target in one move by directly moving an endpoint stone between two others without creating a new endpoint.

**Maximum Moves:**
- Calculate the total distance between the first and last stones and subtract the distances covered by the stones themselves. The idea is to move the stones towards the center, filling gaps. The maximum number of moves would then be the total gap minus (the number of stones minus 1).
- Special cases involve checking for large gaps at the ends of the sorted stones array, which might reduce the number of moves if a stone can jump over a large gap in one move.

Thus, the answer would be an array `[minMoves, maxMoves]`, calculated based on the above strategies, taking into account the sorted positions of the stones, the gaps between them, and the special cases where a single move might suffice or where large gaps significantly influence the number of moves.
