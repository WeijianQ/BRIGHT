# Query `60`

## Original Question

*There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities _i_ and _j_ is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, edges = \[\[0,1,3\],\[1,2,1\],\[1,3,4\],\[2,3,1\]\], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> \[City 1, City 2\] 
City 1 -> \[City 0, City 2, City 3\] 
City 2 -> \[City 0, City 1, City 3\] 
City 3 -> \[City 1, City 2\] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, edges = \[\[0,1,2\],\[0,4,8\],\[1,2,3\],\[1,4,2\],\[2,3,1\],\[3,4,1\]\], distanceThreshold = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> \[City 1\] 
City 1 -> \[City 0, City 4\] 
City 2 -> \[City 3, City 4\] 
City 3 -> \[City 2, City 4\]
City 4 -> \[City 1, City 2, City 3\] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 100`
   `1 <= edges.length <= n  (n - 1) / 2`
   `edges[i].length == 3`
   `0 <= fromi < toi < n`
   `1 <= weighti, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
   All pairs `(fromi, toi)` are distinct.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the city with the minimum number of reachable cities within a given distance threshold, and if there are multiple, to return the one with the greatest number. This problem can be effectively addressed using graph theory concepts, particularly by applying the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm for each city to find the shortest paths to all other cities. Let's break down the steps and relevant information needed to solve this problem:

### 1. Representing the Graph

First, we need to represent the cities and the edges between them in a way that allows us to efficiently perform computations. Since the graph is bidirectional (meaning travel is possible in both directions between any two connected cities), we can use an adjacency matrix or adjacency list to represent the graph. For this problem, using an adjacency matrix might be more straightforward, especially when implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which requires an initial matrix representation.

### 2. Calculating Shortest Paths

To find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. This algorithm iterates over all pairs of vertices and tries to find the shortest path between them using an intermediate vertex. The key formula used in the algorithm is:

`dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])`

where `dist[i][j]` is the shortest distance from city `i` to city `j`, and `k` is an intermediate city. This algorithm runs in O(n^3) time, making it suitable for this problem since `n` is at most 100.

Alternatively, for each city, we could run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths to all other cities. Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient for sparse graphs or when we only need the shortest path from a single source to all destinations. However, since we need the shortest paths between all pairs of cities, and `n` is relatively small, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a more straightforward choice.

### 3. Counting Reachable Cities

After computing the shortest paths, we iterate through each city and count the number of cities that are reachable within the `distanceThreshold`. This involves going through the row corresponding to each city in the distance matrix and counting the entries that are less than or equal to the `distanceThreshold`.

### 4. Finding the Optimal City

Once we have the count of reachable cities for each city, we need to find the city with the minimum number of reachable cities. If there are multiple cities with the same minimum count, we return the one with the greatest number (i.e., the highest index). This step requires a simple linear scan through the counts we've computed, keeping track of the minimum count and the city with the highest index that achieves this count.

### Conclusion

This problem requires understanding graph representation, knowing how to calculate shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a graph, and being able to apply these calculations to derive specific insights (in this case, the city with the minimum number of reachable cities within a distance threshold). Implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute shortest paths, followed by a linear scan to find the optimal city, provides a comprehensive solution to this problem.

The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time` minutes.<br><br>Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green.
