# Query `34`

## Original Question

*You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum area of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0\],\[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\],\[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0\],\[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0\]\]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\]\]
Output: 0

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the maximum area of an island in a given binary matrix, where an island is defined as a group of connected 1's (connected means horizontally or vertically adjacent). The challenge is to navigate through the grid, identify all distinct islands, calculate their areas, and then find the maximum area among them. If no island exists in the grid, the function should return 0.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**: First, we need a variable to keep track of the maximum island area found as we explore the grid. Let's call this `maxArea` and initialize it to 0 since we haven't found any islands yet.

2. **Iterate Through the Grid**: We need to examine each cell in the grid. This requires two nested loops, one to iterate through each row (`m` rows) and another to iterate through each column within those rows (`n` columns).

3. **Identify Land Cells**: As we iterate, we're looking for cells with a value of 1 (land cells). When we find a land cell, it's potentially part of an island, and we need to calculate the area of that island.

4. **Calculate Island Area**: To calculate the area of an island starting from a found land cell, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). These algorithms help us explore all connected land cells (1's) from the starting cell, marking them as visited to avoid counting them more than once. The area of the island is the count of cells visited during the search starting from the initial land cell. 

    - **DFS/BFS Implementation**: For DFS, we can use a recursive approach or a stack, and for BFS, we use a queue. Starting from the initial land cell, we explore all 4-directionally connected cells (up, down, left, right), making sure not to go out of bounds or revisit cells. For each cell that is part of the island (value 1 and not yet visited), we increment a local area counter and mark the cell as visited (to avoid recounting, we can temporarily set its value to 0 or keep a separate visited matrix/grid).

5. **Update Maximum Area**: After calculating the area of an island, we compare it with our current `maxArea`. If the current island's area is larger, we update `maxArea` with this new value.

6. **Continue Until All Cells are Explored**: We continue steps 2-5 until all cells in the grid have been explored. Cells that are part of an already counted island will be skipped (as they are marked visited or set to 0), ensuring each island is only counted once.

7. **Return Maximum Area**: Once the entire grid has been explored, the `maxArea` variable holds the area of the largest island found, or remains 0 if no islands were found. We return this value as the solution.

### Relevant Information:
- The grid is a binary matrix (`m x n`), with `m` rows and `n` columns.
- An island is a group of `1`s connected horizontally or vertically.
- The area of an island is the count of `1`s that make up the island.
- We need to ensure not to count cells more than once or incorrectly link islands that are not connected 4-directionally.

### Conclusion:
This problem combines elements of grid traversal, graph search algorithms (like DFS or BFS), and some careful bookkeeping to ensure correct area calculations and avoid double-counting. The key is efficiently finding and exploring all parts of an island while keeping track of the maximum area found.

These bombs will further detonate the bombs that lie in their ranges.<br><br>Given the list of `bombs`, return _the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one bomb_.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: bombs = \[\[2,1,3\],\[6,1,4\]\]<br>Output: 2<br>Explanation:<br>The above figure shows the positions and ranges of the 2 bombs.<br>If we detonate the left bomb, the right bomb will not be affected.<br>But if we detonate the right bomb, both bombs will be detonated.<br>So the maximum bombs that can be detonated is max(1, 2) = 2.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: bombs = \[\[1,1,5\],\[10,10,5\]\]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation:<br>Detonating either bomb will not detonate the other bomb, so the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated is 1.<br><br>Example 3:<br><br>Input: bombs = \[\[1,2,3\],\[2,3,1\],\[3,4,2\],\[4,5,3\],\[5,6,4\]\]<br>Output: 5<br>Explanation:<br>The best bomb to detonate is bomb 0 because:<br>- Bomb 0 detonates bombs 1 and 2. The red circle denotes the range of bomb 0.<br>- Bomb 2 detonates bomb 3. The blue circle denotes the range of bomb 2.<br>- Bomb 3 detonates bomb 4. The green circle denotes the range of bomb 3.<br>Thus all 5 bombs are detonated.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `1 <= bombs.length <= 100`<br>   `bombs[i].length == 3`<br>   `1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 105`"""<br><br>    if row == len(grid) - 1:<br>        return True<br>    grid[row][col] = 1<br><br>    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]<br><br>    for dr, dc in directions:<br>        nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc<br>        if 0 <= nr < len(grid) and 0 <= nc < len(grid[0]) and grid[nr][nc] == 0:<br>            if can_reach_bottom(grid, nr, nc):<br>                return True<br><br>    return False<br><br>def latestDayToCross(row, col, cells):<br>    grid = [[0]  col for _ in range(row)]<br>    ans = 0<br><br>    for day, cell in enumerate(cells):<br>        grid[cell[0] - 1][cell[1] - 1] = 1<br><br>        found = False<br>        for j in range(col):<br>            if grid[0][j] == 0 and can_reach_bottom(grid, 0, j):<br>                found = True<br>                break<br><br>        if not found:<br>            ans = day<br>            break<br><br>    return ans
