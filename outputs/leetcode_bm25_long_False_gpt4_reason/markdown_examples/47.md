# Query `47`

## Original Question

*You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

   You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
   Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
   Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return _the maximum number of fruits you can pick_.

Example 1:

Input: fruits = \[1,2,1\]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = \[0,1,2,2\]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees \[1,2,2\].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees \[0,1\].

Example 3:

Input: fruits = \[1,2,3,2,2\]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick from trees \[2,3,2,2\].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees \[1,2\].

Constraints:

   `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
   `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is to find the longest subarray from the given array `fruits`, where only two distinct numbers (representing fruit types) are allowed. This subarray represents the maximum number of fruits that can be picked under the given conditions. The challenge lies in efficiently identifying the longest sequence where only two types of fruits are collected while moving from left to right without skipping any trees.

To solve this problem, we can employ a sliding window approach, which is a common technique for dealing with subarray problems. The idea is to maintain a window that can expand or contract depending on the types of fruits encountered and the constraints given (in this case, the two-basket limit). Here are the steps to implement this solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**: We need two pointers to represent the current window's start and end, a hashmap or dictionary to keep track of the count of each fruit type within the window, and a variable to keep track of the maximum number of fruits collected.

2. **Expand the Window**: Starting with an empty window, we move the end pointer to the right, adding each tree's fruit type to the hashmap and updating its count. This step represents picking fruit from each tree as we move along.

3. **Check Basket Constraint**: After each addition, we check if the window contains more than two types of fruits. If it does, this means we cannot carry more types in our baskets, so we need to shrink the window from the left. We do this by reducing the count of the fruit type at the start of the window in the hashmap and, if the count drops to zero, removing that fruit type from the hashmap. This process is repeated until we're back to having only two types of fruits in our baskets (i.e., in our window).

4. **Update Maximum Fruits**: After each step of expanding or shrinking the window, we calculate the current number of fruits in the window (end pointer - start pointer + 1) and update our maximum if the current number is greater.

5. **Repeat Until End**: We repeat steps 2 to 4 until the end pointer has moved through the entire array.

6. **Return Result**: The maximum number of fruits collected, stored in our variable, is returned as the final result.

This sliding window approach ensures that at any point, the window only contains up to two types of fruits, adhering to the basket constraint, and dynamically adjusts to find the longest possible sequence of trees from which fruit can be picked.

**Example Walkthrough (Example 1: fruits = [1,2,1])**

- Initialize: max_fruits = 0, start = 0, hashmap = {}
- Iterate over fruits:
  - Add fruit[0] = 1 to hashmap, max_fruits = 1
  - Add fruit[1] = 2 to hashmap, max_fruits = 2 (window = [1,2])
  - Add fruit[2] = 1 to hashmap, max_fruits = 3 (window = [1,2,1])
- Since we've reached the end, the maximum number of fruits that can be picked is 3.

This method ensures we are always aware of the types of fruits in our current selection and can adjust accordingly to maximize our harvest within the given rules.
