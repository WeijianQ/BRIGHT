# Query `88`

## Original Question

*Given an integer `n`, return `true` _if_ `n` _has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return_ `false`.

An integer `m` is a divisor of `n` if there exists an integer `k` such that `n = k  m`.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 104`*

The essential problem here is to determine if a given integer `n` has exactly three positive divisors. This is a mathematical problem that requires an understanding of factors and the properties of numbers.

To solve this problem, we need to understand what kind of numbers have exactly three positive divisors. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### 1. Understanding Divisors:
- A divisor of a number `n` is any number that can divide `n` without leaving a remainder.
- Every number has at least two divisors: 1 and itself.

### 2. Numbers with Exactly Three Divisors:
- For a number to have exactly three divisors, it must have a unique property. It must be a perfect square of a prime number.
- Why? Because prime numbers have exactly two divisors: 1 and themselves. When you take a prime number `p` and square it to get `p^2`, the divisors of `p^2` are 1, `p` (because `p` is a prime number and can only be divided by 1 and itself), and `p^2`.
- This gives us exactly three divisors: 1, the prime number, and the square of the prime number.

### 3. Implementing the Logic:
- Given this understanding, the solution involves checking if `n` is a perfect square and, if so, whether its square root is a prime number.
- Checking if `n` is a perfect square can be done by taking the square root of `n` and seeing if it is an integer (i.e., the square root operation yields a number without a fractional part).
- If `n` is a perfect square, we then check if its square root is a prime number. This involves checking if the square root has exactly two divisors (1 and itself), which can be done through a simple loop or by using more sophisticated primality tests.

### 4. Example:
- Let's apply this logic to the examples given:
    - For `n = 2`, it's clear that 2 is not a perfect square, so it cannot have exactly three divisors. Thus, the output is `false`.
    - For `n = 4`, we see that 4 is a perfect square (since \(2^2 = 4\)), and 2 is a prime number. Therefore, 4 has exactly three divisors: 1, 2, and 4, making the output `true`.

### 5. Conclusion:
- To solve the problem programmatically, we would write a function that first checks if `n` is a perfect square. If it is, we then check if the square root of `n` is a prime number. If both conditions are met, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.
- It's important to note the constraint `1 <= n <= 10^4`, which is manageable for a brute force check of primality. However, for much larger values of `n`, more efficient primality testing methods would be necessary.

This step-by-step reasoning helps in understanding the underlying mathematical principles and how they can be applied to efficiently solve the problem.
