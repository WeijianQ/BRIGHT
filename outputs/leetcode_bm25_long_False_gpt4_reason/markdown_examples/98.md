# Query `98`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` denotes that course `prevCoursej` has to be completed before course `nextCoursej` (prerequisite relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes how many months it takes to complete the `(i+1)th` course.

You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:

   You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.
   Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.

Return _the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses_.

Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, relations = \[\[1,3\],\[2,3\]\], time = \[3,2,5\]
Output: 8
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. 
We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.
Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.
Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5, relations = \[\[1,5\],\[2,5\],\[3,5\],\[3,4\],\[4,5\]\], time = \[1,2,3,4,5\]
Output: 12
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.
You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.
Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 5  104`
   `0 <= relations.length <= min(n  (n - 1) / 2, 5  104)`
   `relations[j].length == 2`
   `1 <= prevCoursej, nextCoursej <= n`
   `prevCoursej != nextCoursej`
   All the pairs `[prevCoursej, nextCoursej]` are unique.
   `time.length == n`
   `1 <= time[i] <= 104`
   The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the minimum number of months needed to complete all courses given a set of prerequisites and the time it takes to complete each course. This problem is a variation of finding the longest path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where the "longest path" represents the minimum time required to complete all courses under the given constraints.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):** Since the courses form a DAG, there are no cyclic dependencies, ensuring that a valid order of course completion exists.

2. **Prerequisites:** The `relations` array defines a prerequisite relationship between courses, which translates to directed edges in the graph.

3. **Parallel Course Completion:** Multiple courses can be taken simultaneously if their prerequisites are met, impacting the total completion time.

4. **Dynamic Programming (DP) or Topological Sorting:** To solve this problem, methods like DP or topological sorting can be employed to calculate the minimum time required to complete all courses.

### Approach:

1. **Graph Construction:** Represent the courses and their relations using a graph. Each node represents a course, and directed edges represent prerequisite requirements.

2. **Topological Sorting:** Perform a topological sort on the graph. This step orders the courses in a linear sequence where for every directed edge from course `U` to course `V`, `U` comes before `V` in the ordering. This is crucial for processing courses in the correct order, respecting prerequisites.

3. **Calculate Completion Times:** Utilize a dynamic programming approach where, for each course, you calculate the earliest time you can start it based on the completion times of its prerequisites. This involves:

    - Initializing an array, say `completionTime`, of size `n` to store the earliest completion time for each course.
    - Iterating through the courses in topological order and for each course, look at its prerequisites and determine the maximum completion time among those prerequisites.
    - Add the time required to complete the current course to this maximum value to update the `completionTime` for the current course.

4. **Result:** The answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the `completionTime` array since it represents the earliest time all courses can be completed, taking into account the possibility of parallel course completions.

### Example Walkthrough (Example 1):

- **Graph Construction:** From the relations `[[1,3],[2,3]]`, course 3 has prerequisites courses 1 and 2.
- **Topological Sort:** The order can be [1,2,3] or [2,1,3].
- **Calculate Completion Times:**
    - For course 1: No prerequisites, so `completionTime[1] = 3`.
    - For course 2: No prerequisites, so `completionTime[2] = 2`.
    - For course 3: Max completion time among prerequisites (1 and 2) is 3 months, so `completionTime[3] = 3 (prerequisite completion) + 5 (course duration) = 8`.
- **Result:** The maximum value in `completionTime` is 8, indicating the minimum months required.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** O(V+E), where `V` is the number of courses (nodes) and `E` is the number of relations (edges). This accounts for the graph construction and the topological sorting process.
- **Space Complexity:** O(V+E), for storing the graph structure and the additional arrays for DP and topological sort.

This approach efficiently computes the minimum months needed to complete all courses, taking into account both the prerequisites and the ability to complete multiple courses simultaneously.

Initially, all servers are free, and the queue is empty.<br><br>At second `j`, the `jth` task is inserted into the queue (starting with the `0th` task being inserted at second `0`). As long as there are free servers and the queue is not empty, the task in the front of the queue will be assigned to a free server with the smallest weight, and in case of a tie, it is assigned to a free server with the smallest index.<br><br>If there are no free servers and the queue is not empty, we wait until a server becomes free and immediately assign the next task. If multiple servers become free at the same time, then multiple tasks from the queue will be assigned in order of insertion following the weight and index priorities above.<br><br>A server that is assigned task `j` at second `t` will be free again at second `t + tasks[j]`.<br><br>Build an array `ans`​​​​ of length `m`, where `ans[j]` is the index of the server the `j​​​​​​th` task will be assigned to.<br><br>Return _the array_ `ans`​​​​.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: servers = \[3,3,2\], tasks = \[1,2,3,2,1,2\]<br>Output: \[2,2,0,2,1,2\]<br>Explanation: Events in chronological order go as follows:<br>- At second 0, task 0 is added and processed using server 2 until second 1.<br>- At second 1, server 2 becomes free.
