# Query `82`

## Original Question

*There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to `weighti`.

A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A restricted path is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.

Return _the number of restricted paths from node_ `1` _to node_ `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, edges = \[\[1,2,3\],\[1,3,3\],\[2,3,1\],\[1,4,2\],\[5,2,2\],\[3,5,1\],\[5,4,10\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue.` The three restricted paths are:
1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
3) 1 --> 3 --> 5

Example 2:

Input: n = 7, edges = \[\[1,3,1\],\[4,1,2\],\[7,3,4\],\[2,5,3\],\[5,6,1\],\[6,7,2\],\[7,5,3\],\[2,6,4\]\]
Output: 1
Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its `distanceToLastNode value in blue.` The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 2  104`
   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4  104`
   `edges[i].length == 3`
   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
   `ui != vi`
   `1 <= weighti <= 105`
   There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
   There is at least one path between any two nodes.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to count the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node n in an undirected weighted connected graph. A restricted path, by definition, is one where for any two consecutive nodes `zi` and `zi+1` on the path, the shortest distance from `zi` to node n is greater than the shortest distance from `zi+1` to node n. The final answer must be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

To solve this problem, we need to approach it in several steps:

### 1. Calculate Shortest Distances

First, we need to calculate `distanceToLastNode(x)` for every node `x` in the graph, which represents the shortest distance from node `x` to node `n`. This can be efficiently done using Dijkstra's algorithm, starting from node `n`. Since we are interested in the shortest paths to node `n`, running Dijkstra's in reverse (i.e., considering node `n` as the source) helps us find the shortest paths from all nodes to `n`.

### 2. Graph Transformation

After calculating the shortest distances, we can transform the original graph based on these distances. Specifically, for an edge to be part of a restricted path, it must satisfy the condition that the distance from its starting node to node `n` is greater than the distance from its ending node to node `n`. We can remove edges that do not satisfy this condition.

### 3. Counting Restricted Paths

With the transformed graph, we need to count the number of paths from node 1 to node n that satisfy the restricted path condition. This can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Dynamic Programming (DP).

- **DFS Approach**: Starting from node 1, perform a depth-first search. Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid revisiting and thus avoid infinite loops. Whenever you reach node `n`, you've found a restricted path. This approach, however, might need memoization to optimize because of overlapping subproblems.
  
- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: A more efficient way could be to use DP, where `dp[x]` represents the number of restricted paths from node `x` to node `n`. The base case is `dp[n] = 1` (there's one path from `n` to `n`, which is the node itself). For other nodes, you can sum up the `dp` values of all its neighbors that satisfy the restricted path condition (i.e., neighbors for which the distance to `n` is less than the current node's distance to `n`).

### 4. Modulo Operation

Given that the final answer can be very large, it's necessary to perform a modulo operation (`10^9 + 7`) at every addition step to keep the numbers manageable and within the problem's constraints.

### 5. Algorithm Complexity

- The complexity of running Dijkstra's algorithm is O((E + V) log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices. This is because each edge and vertex is processed once, and the use of a priority queue (or similar structure) introduces a log V factor for maintaining the queue.
- The complexity of the DFS or DP step depends on the graph's structure but will not exceed O(V+E) for processing each vertex and edge a constant number of times.

### Conclusion

This problem combines graph theory with dynamic programming or depth-first search techniques. By first determining the shortest paths to the target node, transforming the graph based on these distances, and then counting the number of valid paths using either DFS with memoization or DP, we can efficiently solve the problem. The key to optimizing the solution lies in correctly implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and choosing the most suitable method (DFS with memoization or DP) for counting the paths based on the transformed graph's properties.
