# Query `58`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

Example 1:

Input: piles = \[2,7,9,4,4\]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 

Example 2:

Input: piles = \[1,2,3,4,5,100\]
Output: 104

Constraints:

   `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
   `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is a dynamic game theory problem involving optimal strategies for two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking piles of stones with the goal of maximizing their own total number of stones. The unique twist in this problem is the dynamic nature of the rule that determines how many piles a player can take in a turn, which is based on the maximum number of piles taken by any player in the previous turns.

To address this problem, we need to think about the strategy that each player will employ to maximize their own outcome while minimizing the opponent's gain. Since both players are playing optimally, we can assume that each decision made will be the best possible move given the current state of the game.

Here are some steps and considerations for devising a solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** This problem seems well-suited for a dynamic programming approach because the optimal decision at any point depends on the outcomes of future decisions, which in turn depend on the state of the game (i.e., how many piles are left and the current value of M).

2. **State Representation:** To use DP, we need a way to represent the state of the game. A state can be represented by a tuple `(i, M)`, where `i` indicates the starting pile for the current turn, and `M` represents the maximum number of piles a player can take on this turn. The state space will thus encapsulate all possible game scenarios as the game progresses.

3. **DP Equation:** We need to formulate a DP equation that relates different states of the game. For a given state `(i, M)`, the number of stones a player can take is the sum of the stones in the piles they decide to take. The goal is to maximize the stones taken by Alice and minimize those taken by Bob, acknowledging that Bob will also play optimally. The DP equation needs to account for the choice of taking anywhere from 1 to `2M` piles, updating `M` accordingly, and considering the remaining piles for the opponent's turn.

4. **Base Case:** The base case occurs when there are no more piles left to take (i.e., when `i` exceeds the length of the `piles` array). In this case, the number of stones that can be taken is 0, as there are no more moves to make.

5. **Memoization:** To avoid recalculating the number of stones that can be taken from the same game state, we can use memoization to store the results of each state `(i, M)` after it is computed for the first time. This significantly reduces the computational complexity.

6. **Optimization and Implementation:** The final step is to implement the DP solution with memoization, starting from the initial state `(0, 1)` (since Alice starts first and `M` is initially 1), and recursively calculate the maximum number of stones Alice can take by exploring all possible moves and choosing the one that maximizes her outcome while assuming Bob plays optimally.

By applying these steps, we can devise a solution that computes the maximum number of stones Alice can get by making optimal choices throughout the game, given the dynamic nature of the rule that determines how many piles can be taken in each turn.
