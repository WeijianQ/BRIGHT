# Query `103`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob want to water `n` plants in their garden. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where the `ith` plant is located at `x = i`.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:

   Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the `0th` plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the `(n - 1)th` plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.
   It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.
   Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.
   In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and two integers `capacityA` and `capacityB` representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return _the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants_.

Example 1:

Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.
- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Example 2:

Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.
- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.
- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.
- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.
So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Example 3:

Input: plants = \[5\], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8
Output: 0
Explanation:
- There is only one plant.
- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.
So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.

Constraints:

   `n == plants.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= plants[i] <= 106`
   `max(plants[i]) <= capacityA, capacityB <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the total number of times Alice and Bob have to refill their watering cans to water all the plants in their garden, given their initial capacities and the water requirement of each plant. The challenge lies in the fact that their capacities deplete as they water plants from opposite ends of a row, and they may need to refill depending on whether they have enough water for the next plant in line. Moreover, when they meet at the same plant, the decision on who waters it depends on their current water levels, adding another layer to consider.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Traversal and Meeting Point**: Alice and Bob start watering from opposite ends and potentially meet at some plant. The exact meeting point will depend on the number of plants and their watering patterns. This meeting point is crucial since it determines the last plant they individually water before possibly needing to refill.

2. **Capacity Tracking and Refills**: For each plant, check if Alice or Bob has enough water to water the plant. If not, they refill (which counts as one refill operation) and then water the plant. This implies keeping track of their current water capacity as they progress.

3. **Decision at the Meeting Plant**: If they reach the same plant simultaneously, decide who waters it based on their current water levels or Alice by default if they are equal. This decision does not directly affect the refill count but determines who waters the plant and hence, the depletion of their can's water.

4. **Efficiency in Watering**: It's essential to note that watering is only efficient if they can fully water a plant. This rule may necessitate more frequent refills but ensures each plant gets the exact amount of water needed.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start with variables to track Alice's and Bob's current water levels, set to their initial capacities. Also, initialize a counter for the total refills.

2. **Iterate Through Plants**: Loop through the plants from both ends towards the center. For each plant Alice and Bob attempt to water, check if their current capacity is sufficient.

    - If Alice's/Bob's current water level is less than the plant's need, increment the refill counter for the respective person, and reset their water level to their capacity before watering the plant.
    - If they meet at the same plant, compare their current water levels to decide who waters it (Alice if they are equal).

3. **Continue Until All Plants Are Watered**: The process continues until all plants are accounted for, which happens when Alice and Bob either meet or cross paths.

4. **Return the Total Refill Count**: After all plants are watered, the total number of refills by both Alice and Bob combined is the answer.

### Considerations:

- **Optimization**: The algorithm can be optimized by determining in advance the meeting point based on their capacities and the plants' requirements, though this requires a more complex analysis.
- **Edge Cases**: Scenarios with a single plant or when either Alice or Bob can water all plants without refilling should be handled separately to avoid unnecessary calculations.

This problem combines elements of array traversal, condition-based decision-making, and arithmetic operations to find the solution. The primary challenge lies in efficiently tracking and updating Alice's and Bob's capacities while accounting for their interaction at the meeting point.
