# Query `57`

## Original Question

*In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.

Example 1:

Input: label = 14
Output: \[1,3,4,14\]

Example 2:

Input: label = 26
Output: \[1,2,6,10,26\]

Constraints:

   `1 <= label <= 10^6`*

To solve this problem, we need to navigate from the given `label` back to the root of the binary tree, understanding that the tree's labeling alternates direction by row. Here's a step-by-step approach to finding the path from the `label` back to the root:

1. **Identify the Row of the Label**: First, we need to figure out which row our `label` is in. Since the tree is infinite and binary, each row doubles in the number of nodes from the previous one, starting with 1 node in the first row, 2 in the second, 4 in the third, and so on. The number of nodes in the nth row is 2^(n-1). We can use this to determine the row of our label.

2. **Determine Row Labeling Order**: Once we know the row, we need to understand whether it's labeled left-to-right or right-to-left. Odd rows are labeled left-to-right, and even rows are labeled right-to-left.

3. **Calculate the Label's Position in Its Row**: For rows labeled left-to-right, the position of our `label` in its row is straightforward to calculate. However, for rows labeled right-to-left, we need to calculate the position differently since the labeling is reversed.

4. **Trace Back to the Root**: To find the path from our `label` back to the root, we work our way up the tree. In a binary tree, you can find a node's parent by dividing the node's position by 2 (for left-to-right rows) or doing a similar calculation adjusted for right-to-left rows. As we move up the tree, we need to keep track of the direction of labeling for each row to accurately calculate the parent's label.

5. **Reverse Calculation for Right-to-Left Rows**: For right-to-left labeled rows, the calculation of a node's parent label needs to account for the reversed labeling. This involves understanding the total number of nodes in the row, the position of our node within that row from a right-to-left perspective, and then translating that position to what it would be in a left-to-right perspective to correctly identify the parent node.

6. **Construct the Path**: Starting with our `label`, we calculate its parent using the steps above, then move to that parent and repeat the process until we reach the root of the tree. We keep a record of each label encountered on this journey. Since we're moving from the `label` up to the root, our final step will be to reverse the collected labels to present the path from the root to our `label`.

**Example Solution for Label 14**:

1. **Find Row**: Label 14 is in the 4th row because the 3rd row ends with 7 (1 + 2 + 4) and the 4th row has 8 nodes (2^3), making the range of labels 8 to 15.
2. **Row Labeling Order**: The 4th row is labeled right-to-left.
3. **Label's Position**: In a right-to-left labeling, 14 is the second node from the right in its row.
4. **Trace Back to the Root**: 
    - The parent of 14 in a left-to-right perspective would be found by dividing its position by 2, but since it's right-to-left, we adjust our calculation.
    - For label 14, its parent is 4 (considering the right-to-left adjustment).
    - Repeating this process up the tree: 14's parent is 4, 4's parent is 3, and 3's parent is 1.
5. **Construct the Path**: Starting with 14, then to 4, to 3, and finally to 1, we get the path [14, 4, 3, 1]. Reversing it gives us [1, 3, 4, 14].

**Example Solution for Label 26** follows a similar approach, identifying its row, the labeling order of that row, calculating positions and parents accordingly, and constructing the path from the label to the root.

This method systematically navigates the tree's unique labeling scheme to find the desired path.
