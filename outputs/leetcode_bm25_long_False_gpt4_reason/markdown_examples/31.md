# Query `31`

## Original Question

*There is a room with `n` bulbs labeled from `1` to `n` that all are turned on initially, and four buttons on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

   Button 1: Flips the status of all the bulbs.
   Button 2: Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., `2, 4, ...`).
   Button 3: Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., `1, 3, ...`).
   Button 4: Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label `j = 3k + 1` where `k = 0, 1, 2, ...` (i.e., `1, 4, 7, 10, ...`).

You must make exactly `presses` button presses in total. For each press, you may pick any of the four buttons to press.

Given the two integers `n` and `presses`, return _the number of different possible statuses after performing all_ `presses` _button presses_.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1, presses = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be:
- \[off\] by pressing button 1
- \[on\] by pressing button 2

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, presses = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be:
- \[off, off\] by pressing button 1
- \[on, off\] by pressing button 2
- \[off, on\] by pressing button 3

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, presses = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be:
- \[off, off, off\] by pressing button 1
- \[off, on, off\] by pressing button 2
- \[on, off, on\] by pressing button 3
- \[off, on, on\] by pressing button 4

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 1000`
   `0 <= presses <= 1000`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
To solve this problem, we need to understand the impact of each button press on the bulbs' statuses and how combinations of these presses can lead to different statuses. The essential problem is to calculate the number of unique statuses that can be achieved by pressing any combination of the four buttons exactly `presses` times.

### Button Press Effects

1. **Button 1** flips the status of all bulbs. If all bulbs are on, they all turn off, and vice versa.
2. **Button 2** flips the status of all even-labeled bulbs.
3. **Button 3** flips the status of all odd-labeled bulbs.
4. **Button 4** flips the status of bulbs labeled with `j = 3k + 1` (i.e., 1, 4, 7, ...).

### Key Observations

- **Commutative Property**: The order of button presses doesn't matter; what matters is how many times each button is pressed.
- **Button 1 and Button 4**: Pressing Button 1 and then Button 4 has the same effect as pressing Button 4 and then Button 1.
- **Cancelation**: Pressing any button twice cancels out the effect, returning those bulbs to their original states.

### Strategy

1. **Odd vs. Even Presses**: If we press a button an even number of times, it's as if we never pressed it. Thus, for each button, we only need to consider whether it's pressed an odd or even number of times.
2. **Combining Effects**: Some combinations of presses effectively mimic other buttons. For example, pressing Button 1 and then Button 2 is the same as pressing Button 3.
3. **Reducing Redundancy**: Since pressing any button twice is redundant, we only need to consider the case where a button is pressed once or not pressed at all for calculating unique statuses.
4. **Button Press Limits**: If `presses` is greater than the number of bulbs, certain patterns of presses will start to repeat, limiting the number of unique statuses.

### Calculation Approach

Given the constraints and observations:

- If `n = 1`, the maximum unique statuses we can achieve are 2, since there's only one bulb, and each button press only toggles its state.
- For `n > 1` and `presses = 1`, we can directly count the unique statuses based on the description (as seen in the examples).
- For larger values of `n` and `presses`, we need to consider the combinations of button presses that lead to unique outcomes.

### Unique Statuses Calculation

The unique statuses depend on how the combinations of button presses affect subsets of bulbs. Given `n` bulbs and `presses` presses:

1. **Base Cases**: With 0 presses, there's only 1 possible status (all on). With 1 press, the possibilities increase as shown in the examples.
2. **Presses and Bulb Parity**: The parity of bulbs (even vs. odd) and special positions (like `j = 3k + 1`) play a crucial role. We need to consider how pressing buttons that affect these groups can lead to unique statuses.
3. **Presses Impact**: More presses generally increase the number of possible statuses, but this growth is not unbounded due to the cancelation effect mentioned earlier.

### Algorithmic Approach

An algorithmic approach would involve:

1. Identifying all unique combinations of button presses within the given `presses`.
2. Calculating the effect of each combination on the bulb statuses.
3. Counting the unique outcomes.

Given the complexity of calculating this directly for larger `n` and `presses`, a more detailed mathematical analysis or a dynamic programming approach might be required to efficiently calculate the exact number of unique statuses. For small values of `n` and `presses`, brute force could work, but for larger values, optimizations considering the observations above are necessary.

Hursts observations of the problem of long-term<br>    storage in water reservoirs. If x_i is the discharge of a river in year i<br>    and we observe this discharge for N years, we can calculate the storage<br>    capacity that would be required to keep the discharge steady at its mean<br>    value.<br><br>    To do so, we first substract the mean over all x_i from the individual<br>    x_i to obtain the departures x'_i from the mean for each year i. As the<br>    excess or deficit in discharge always carrys over from year i to year i+1,<br>    we need to examine the cumulative sum of x'_i, denoted by y_i. This<br>    cumulative sum represents the filling of our hypothetical storage. If the<br>    sum is above 0, we are storing excess discharge from the river, if it is<br>    below zero we have compensated a deficit in discharge by releasing<br>    water from the storage. The range (maximum - minimum) R of y_i therefore<br>    represents the total capacity required for the storage.<br><br>    Hurst showed that this value follows a steady trend for varying N if it<br>    is normalized by the standard deviation sigma over the x_i. Namely he<br>    obtained the following formula:<br><br>    R/sigma = (N/2)^K<br><br>    In this equation, K is called the Hurst exponent. Its value is 0.5 for<br>    white noise, but becomes greater for time series that exhibit some positive<br>    dependency on previous values. For negative dependencies it becomes less<br>    than 0.5.<br><br>  Explanation of the algorithm:<br>    The rescaled range (R/S) approach is directly derived from Hurst's<br>    definition. The time series of length N is split into non-overlapping<br>    subseries of length n. Then, R and S (S = sigma) are calculated for each<br>    subseries and the mean is taken over all subseries yielding (R/S)_n. This<br>    process is repeated for several lengths n. Finally, the exponent K is<br>    obtained by fitting a straight line to the plot of log((R/S)_n) vs log(n).<br><br>    There seems to be no consensus how to chose the subseries lenghts n.<br>    This function therefore leaves the choice to the user.

The length is reduced by at<br>             most 1% to find the value that has the most divisors.<br><br>              The "Simple R/S" estimate is just log((R/S)_n) / log(n) for <br>               n = N.<br>              The "theoretical Hurst exponent" is the value that would be<br>               expected of an uncorrected rescaled range approach for random<br>               noise of the size of the input data.<br>              The "empirical Hurst exponent" is the uncorrected Hurst exponent<br>               obtained by the rescaled range approach.<br>              The "corrected empirical Hurst exponent" is the Anis-Lloyd-Peters<br>               corrected Hurst exponent, but with sqrt(1/2  pi  n) added to<br>               the (R/S)_n before the log.<br>              The "corrected R over S Hurst exponent" uses the R-function "lm"<br>               instead of pracmas own "polyfit" and uses n = N/2, N/4, N/8, ...<br>               by successively halving the subsequences (which means that some<br>               subsequences may be one element longer than others).
