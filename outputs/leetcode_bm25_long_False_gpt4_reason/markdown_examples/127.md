# Query `127`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. You have `5` cards where the `ith` card has a rank of `ranks[i]` and a suit of `suits[i]`.

The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:

1.  `"Flush "`: Five cards of the same suit.
2.  `"Three of a Kind "`: Three cards of the same rank.
3.  `"Pair "`: Two cards of the same rank.
4.  `"High Card "`: Any single card.

Return _a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards._

Note that the return values are case-sensitive.

Example 1:

Input: ranks = \[13,2,3,1,9\], suits = \[ "a ", "a ", "a ", "a ", "a "\]
Output:  "Flush "
Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a  "Flush ".

Example 2:

Input: ranks = \[4,4,2,4,4\], suits = \[ "d ", "a ", "a ", "b ", "c "\]
Output:  "Three of a Kind "
Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a  "Three of a Kind ".
Note that we could also make a  "Pair " hand but  "Three of a Kind " is a better hand.
Also note that other cards could be used to make the  "Three of a Kind " hand.

Example 3:

Input: ranks = \[10,10,2,12,9\], suits = \[ "a ", "b ", "c ", "a ", "d "\]
Output:  "Pair "
Explanation: The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards with the same rank, so we have a  "Pair ".
Note that we cannot make a  "Flush " or a  "Three of a Kind ".

Constraints:

   `ranks.length == suits.length == 5`
   `1 <= ranks[i] <= 13`
   `'a' <= suits[i] <= 'd'`
   No two cards have the same rank and suit.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
To determine the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards, we need to analyze the provided `ranks` and `suits` arrays based on the rules of poker hands. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Types of Hands

1. **Flush:** All five cards are of the same suit.
2. **Three of a Kind:** Three cards of the same rank.
3. **Pair:** Two cards of the same rank.
4. **High Card:** No other hand, the highest card is considered.

### Step 2: Analyze the Suits

- To check for a Flush, we need to see if all elements in the `suits` array are the same. If they are, we can immediately return `"Flush "` as it is the highest possible hand given the options.

### Step 3: Analyze the Ranks

- For "Three of a Kind" and "Pair", we need to count the occurrences of each rank in the `ranks` array.
- If any rank appears exactly three times, we have a "Three of a Kind".
- If not, we check if any rank appears exactly twice, indicating a "Pair".

### Step 4: Implement the Logic

- **Flush Check:** Iterate through the `suits` array and check if all suits are the same. If yes, return `"Flush "`.
- **Rank Occurrences:** Create a map or a frequency array to count how many times each rank appears. This is crucial for identifying "Three of a Kind" or "Pair".
  - If a rank is found to appear three times, return `"Three of a Kind "`.
  - If no rank appears three times but one appears twice, return `"Pair "`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, return `"High Card "` as the default case since we always have at least one card.

### Example Analysis

Let’s apply this logic to the given examples:

**Example 1:**

- `ranks = [13,2,3,1,9]`, `suits = ["a", "a", "a", "a", "a"]`
- All suits are `"a"`, so we have a Flush. Return `"Flush "`.

**Example 2:**

- `ranks = [4,4,2,4,4]`, `suits = ["d", "a", "a", "b", "c"]`
- The rank `4` appears four times, but since the question setup implies we're only looking for up to "Three of a Kind", this would still qualify as "Three of a Kind". Return `"Three of a Kind "`.

**Example 3:**

- `ranks = [10,10,2,12,9]`, `suits = ["a", "b", "c", "a", "d"]`
- The rank `10` appears twice, indicating a "Pair". Return `"Pair "`.

### Conclusion

By analyzing both the suits and ranks of the cards, we can identify the best poker hand possible. The key is to first check for a Flush as it overrides other combinations, then count the occurrences of each rank to identify "Three of a Kind" or "Pair", defaulting to "High Card" if none of these conditions are met.
