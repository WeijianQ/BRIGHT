# Query `71`

## Original Question

*There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

   On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
   Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, the same color cannot be used again.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `targetGrid`, where `targetGrid[row][col]` is the color in the position `(row, col)` of the grid.

Return `true` _if it is possible to print the matrix_ `targetGrid`_,_ _otherwise, return_ `false`.

Example 1:

Input: targetGrid = \[\[1,1,1,1\],\[1,2,2,1\],\[1,2,2,1\],\[1,1,1,1\]\]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: targetGrid = \[\[1,1,1,1\],\[1,1,3,3\],\[1,1,3,4\],\[5,5,1,4\]\]
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: targetGrid = \[\[1,2,1\],\[2,1,2\],\[1,2,1\]\]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to form targetGrid because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.

Constraints:

   `m == targetGrid.length`
   `n == targetGrid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 60`
   `1 <= targetGrid[row][col] <= 60`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine if it's possible to recreate the `targetGrid` by sequentially printing solid rectangles of color onto a grid, given that each color can only be used once in the printing process. This involves understanding the spatial and sequential constraints placed on the printing process by the initial conditions and the structure of the `targetGrid`.

To approach this problem, let's break it down step by step, considering the relevant information and reasoning required to address the question in detail:

### 1. Analyze Color Layers

The problem can be thought of in terms of layers of colors. A color forming a rectangle in the `targetGrid` can be considered a layer that was printed in a single operation. For a successful printing sequence:
- A color used must form a solid rectangle (i.e., all its instances must form a contiguous block without interruptions by other colors).
- Once a color is printed, it cannot be used again, implying that colors on top must be printed after the colors below.

### 2. Identify the Order of Printing

To determine if the `targetGrid` can be printed:
- Identify the topmost layer: This color should be on the surface, not fully surrounded by any other color at any edge.
- Remove the topmost layer and analyze the next. This simulates the printing process in reverse.
- If at any point the remaining grid cannot form a solid rectangle of a single color without being interrupted by other colors, the grid is impossible to print according to the rules.

### 3. Edge and Corner Cases

Special attention should be given to cases where colors wrap around others in a way that would prevent their removal without violating the single-use color rule. For example, a color appearing in non-adjacent sections or forming a ring around another color can complicate or invalidate the printing sequence.

### 4. Implementation

A practical approach to solving this problem programmatically could involve:
- Tracking the usage of colors and their positions.
- Iteratively identifying and removing the outermost layers.
- Checking for the integrity of each layer to ensure it forms a solid rectangle.

### 5. Verification

For the provided examples:
- **Example 1** forms a simple case where the middle color (2) can be printed after the surrounding color (1). This is a straightforward `true` scenario.
- **Example 2** is more complex but still possible. The sequence could start with color 5, then colors 4, 3, and finally 1, layer by layer.
- **Example 3** presents an impossible scenario because colors 1 and 2 form an alternating pattern that prevents forming a solid rectangle without interruptions, making a valid sequence impossible.

### Conclusion

Determining if `targetGrid` can be printed involves analyzing the spatial arrangement of colors, understanding the sequence in which layers can be removed (simulating the printing process in reverse), and ensuring that each step adheres to the rule that each color can only be used once. This problem combines aspects of graph theory, spatial analysis, and algorithmic sequence verification to arrive at a solution.

For<br>    most cases, the default options should work relatively well.<br><br>    Method:<br>      (1) Prepare for registration by several intitialization substeps:<br>            a. Extract the polar angle, eccentricity and weight data from the hemisphere. These<br>               data are usually properties on the mesh and can be modifies by the options<br>               polar_angle, eccentricity, and weight, which can be either property names or list<br>               of property values. By default (None), a property is chosen using the functions<br>               neuropythy.vision.extract_retinotopy_argument with the default option set to<br>               'empirical'.<br>            b. If partial voluming correction is enabled (via the option<br>               partial_voluming_correction), multiply the weight by (1 - p) where p is <br>               hemi.partial_volume_factor.<br>            c. If there is a prior that is specified as a belief about the retinotopy, then a<br>               Registration is created for the hemisphere such that its vertices are arranged<br>               according to that prior (see also the prior option). Note that because hemi's<br>               coordinates must always be projected into the registration specified by the model,<br>               the prior must be the name of a registration to which the model's specified subject<br>               is also registered. This is clear in the case of an example. The default value for<br>               this is 'retinotopy'; assuming that our model is specified on the fsaverage_sym, <br>               surface, the initial positions of the coordinates for the registration process would<br>               be the result of starting with hemi's fsaverage_sym-aligned coordinates then warping<br>               these coordinates in a way that is equivalent to the warping from fsaverage_sym's <br>               native spherical coordinates to fsaverage_sym's retinotopy registration coordinates.<br>               Note that the retinotopy registration would usually be specified in a file in the<br>               fsaverage_sym subject's surf directory: surf/lh.retinotopy.sphere.reg.<br>               If no prior is specified (option value None), then the vertices that are used are<br>               those aligned with the registration of the model, which will usually be 'fsaverage'<br>               or 'fsaverage_sym'.<br>            d. If the option resample is not None, then the vertex coordinates are resampled onto<br>               either the fsaverage or fsaverage_sym's native sphere surface. (The value of resample<br>               should be either 'fsaverage' or 'fsaverage_sym'.) Resampling can prevent vertices<br>               that have been rearranged by alignment with the model's specified registration or by<br>               application of a prior from beginning the alignment with very high initial gradients<br>               and is recommended for subject alignments.<br>               If resample is None then no changes are made.<br>            e. A 2D projection of the (possibly aligned, prior-warped, and resampled) cortical<br>               surface is made according to the projection parameters of the model. This map is the<br>               mesh that is warped to eventually fit the model.<br>      (2) Perform the registration by running neuropythy.registration.mesh_register. This step<br>          consists of two major components.<br>            a. Create the potential function, which we will minimize. The potential function is a<br>               complex function whose inputs are the coordinates of all of the vertices and whose<br>               output is a potential value that increases both as the mesh is warped and as the<br>               vertices with retinotopy predictions get farther away from the positions in the model<br>               that their retinotopy values would predict they should lie. The balance of these<br>               two forces is best controlled by the option functional_scale. The potential function<br>               fundamentally consists of four terms; the first three describe mesh deformations and<br>               the last describes the model fit.<br>                - The edge deformation term is described for any vertices u and v that are connected<br>                  by an edge in the mesh; it's value is c/p (r(u,v) - r0(u,v))^2 where c is the<br>                  edge_scale, p is the number of edges in the mesh, r(a,b) is the distance between<br>                  vertices a and b, and r0(a,b) is the distance between a and b in the initial mesh.<br>                - The angle deformation term is described for any three vertices (u,v,w) that form<br>                  an angle in the mesh; its value is c/m h(t(u,v,w), t0(u,v,w)) where c is the<br>                  angle_scale argument, m is the number of angles in the mesh, t is the value of the<br>                  angle (u,v,w), t0 is the value of the angle in the initial mesh, and h(t,t0) is an<br>                  infinite-well function that asymptotes to positive infinity as t approaches both 0<br>                  and pi and is minimal when t = t0 (see the nben's <br>                  nben.mesh.registration.InfiniteWell documentation for more details).<br>                - The perimeter term prevents the perimeter vertices form moving significantly;<br>                  this primarily prevents the mesh from wrapping in on itself during registration.<br>                  The form of this term is, for any vertex u on the mesh perimeter, <br>                  (x(u) - x0(u))^2 where x and x0 are the position and initial position of the<br>                  vertex.<br>                - Finally, the functional term is minimized when the vertices best align with the<br>                  retinotopy model.<br>            b. Register the mesh vertices to the potential function using the nben Java library. The<br>               particular parameters of the registration are method, max_steps, and max_step_size.<br><br>    Options:<br>       model specifies the instance of the retinotopy model to use; this must be an<br>        instance of the RegisteredRetinotopyModel class or a string that can be passed to the<br>        retinotopy_model() function (default: 'standard').<br>       model_hemi specifies the hemisphere of the model; generally you shouldn't have to set this<br>        unless you are using an fsaverage_sym model, in which case it should be set to None; in all<br>        other cases, the default value (Ellipsis) instructs the function to auto-detect the<br>        hemisphere.<br>       polar_angle, eccentricity, pRF_radius, and weight specify the property names for the<br>        respective quantities; these may alternately be lists or numpy arrays of values. If weight<br>        is not given or found, then unity weight for all vertices is assumed. By default, each will<br>        check the  hemisphere's properties for properties with compatible names; it will prefer the<br>        properties PRF_polar_angle, PRF_ecentricity, and PRF_variance_explained if possible.<br>       weight_min (default: 0.1) specifies the minimum value a vertex must have in the weight<br>        property in order to be considered as retinotopically relevant.<br>       eccentricity_range (default: None) specifies that any vertex whose eccentricity is too low<br>        or too high should be given a weight of 0 in the registration.<br>       partial_voluming_correction (default: True), if True, specifies that the value<br>        (1 - hemi.partial_volume_factor) should be applied to all weight values (i.e., weights<br>        should be down-weighted when likely to be affected by a partial voluming error).<br>       field_sign_weight (default: 1) indicates the relative weight (between 0 and 1) that should<br>        be given to the field-sign as a method of determining which anchors have the strongest<br>        springs. A value of 1 indicates that the effective weights of anchors should be the <br>        geometric mean of the empirical retinotopic weight and field-sign-based weight; a value of 0<br>        indicates that no attention should be paid to the field sign weight.<br>       radius_weight (default: 1) indicates the relative weight (between 0 and 1) that should<br>        be given to the pRF radius as a method of determining which anchors have the strongest<br>        springs. A value of 1 indicates that the effective weights of anchors should be the <br>        geometric mean of the empirical retinotopic weight and pRF-radius-based weight; a value of 0<br>        indicates that no attention should be paid to the radius-based weight.<br>       sigma specifies the standard deviation of the Gaussian shape for the Schira model anchors;<br>        see retinotopy_anchors for more information.<br>       scale (default: 1.0) specifies the strength of the functional constraints (i.e. the anchors:<br>        the part of the minimization responsible for ensuring that retinotopic coordinates are<br>        aligned); the anatomical constraints (i.e. the edges and angles: the part of the<br>        minimization responsible for ensuring that the mesh is not overly deformed) are always held<br>        at a strength of 1.0.<br>       select specifies the select option that should be passed to retinotopy_anchors.<br>       max_steps (default 2,000) specifies the maximum number of registration steps to run. This<br>        may be a tuple (max_steps, stride) in which case the registered map that is returned will<br>        contain a piece of meta-data, 'trajectory' containing the vertex coordinates every stride<br>        steps of the registration.<br>       max_step_size (default 0.05) specifies the maxmim distance a single vertex is allowed to<br>        move in a single step of the minimization.<br>       method (default 'random') is the method argument passed to mesh_register. This should be<br>        'random', 'pure', or 'nimble'. Generally, 'random' is recommended.<br>       yield_imap (default: False) specifies whether the return value should be the new<br>        Mesh object or a pimms imap (i.e., a persistent mapping of the result of a pimms<br>        calculation) containing the meta-data that was used during the registration<br>        calculations. If this is True, then register_retinotopy will return immediately, and<br>        calculations will only be performed as the relevant data are requested from the returned<br>        imap. The item 'predicted_mesh' gives the return value when yield_imap is set to False.<br>       radius (default: pi/3) specifies the radius, in radians, of the included portion of the map<br>        projection (projected about the occipital pole).<br>       sigma (default Ellipsis) specifies the sigma argument to be passed onto the <br>        retinotopy_anchors function (see help(retinotopy_anchors)); the default value, Ellipsis,<br>        is interpreted as the default value of the retinotopy_anchors function's sigma option.<br>       prior (default: None) specifies the prior that should be used, if found, in the <br>        topology registrations for the subject associated with the retinotopy_model's registration.<br>       resample (default: Ellipsis) specifies that the data should be resampled to one of<br>        the uniform meshes, 'fsaverage' or 'fsaverage_sym', prior to registration; if None then no<br>        resampling is performed; if Ellipsis, then auto-detect either fsaverage or fsaverage_sym<br>        based on the model_hemi option (if it is None, fsaverage_sym, else fsaverage).<br>    '''<br>    # create the imap<br>    m = retinotopy_registration(<br>        cortex=hemi, model_argument=model, model_hemi=model_hemi,<br>        polar_angle=polar_angle, eccentricity=eccentricity, weight=weight, pRF_radius=pRF_radius,<br>        weight_min=weight_min,  eccentricity_range=eccentricity_range,<br>        partial_voluming_correction=partial_voluming_correction,<br>        radius_weight=radius_weight, field_sign_weight=field_sign_weight,<br>        invert_rh_field_sign=invert_rh_field_sign,<br>        scale=scale, sigma=sigma, select=select, prior=prior, resample=resample, radius=radius,<br>        max_steps=max_steps, max_step_size=max_step_size, method=method)<br>    return m if yield_imap else m['predicted_mesh']
