# Query `138`

## Original Question

*There is a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices. The vertices are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has exactly one monkey. The following figure shows a convex polygon of `6` vertices.

Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex `i` can be:

   the vertex `(i + 1) % n` in the clockwise direction, or
   the vertex `(i - 1 + n) % n` in the counter-clockwise direction.

A collision happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement or intersect on an edge.

Return _the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least one collision_ _happens_. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

Note that each monkey can only move once.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 8 total possible movements.
Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
- Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
- Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.
It can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: It can be shown that there are 14 ways for the monkeys to collide.

Constraints:

   `3 <= n <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

To approach this problem, let's break it down step by step and identify the key components and calculations needed to find the number of ways monkeys can move resulting in at least one collision.

### Understanding the Problem

We are given a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices, and each vertex has exactly one monkey. Monkeys can move to a neighboring vertex either in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. We need to find the number of ways these moves can result in at least one collision, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A collision can occur in two ways:
1. **Direct Collision**: Two monkeys move to the same vertex.
2. **Edge Intersection**: Two monkeys cross paths along an edge.

### Total Possible Moves

First, let's calculate the total number of possible moves without any restrictions. Each monkey has 2 choices (move clockwise or counter-clockwise), and since there are `n` monkeys, the total number of possible moves is `2^n`.

### Moves Without Collision

To find the number of ways at least one collision happens, we need to subtract the number of collision-free moves from the total possible moves. Collision-free moves occur when all monkeys move in the same direction (all clockwise or all counter-clockwise). There are exactly 2 such scenarios.

### Calculating Collisions

Hence, the number of ways at least one collision occurs is:
\[ TotalMoves - CollisionFreeMoves = 2^n - 2 \]

### Modulo Operation

Since the answer can be very large, we perform a modulo operation with `10^9 + 7` to find the final result. This is a common practice to keep the numbers within a manageable range and is often required in programming contests and computer science problems.

### Final Formula

\[ Result = (2^n - 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

### Example Calculation

For `n = 3`, the calculation would be:
\[ Result = (2^3 - 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) = (8 - 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 6 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 6 \]

For `n = 4`, it's:
\[ Result = (2^4 - 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) = (16 - 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 14 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 14 \]

### Implementation Note

When implementing this formula, care should be taken to ensure that the modulo operation is correctly applied, especially when dealing with languages that have a specific way of handling large numbers or the modulo operation.

### Conclusion

This problem boils down to calculating the total possible moves, identifying the moves that don't result in collisions, and subtracting these to find the moves that result in at least one collision. The key to solving it is understanding how to apply the modulo operation to manage large numbers.
