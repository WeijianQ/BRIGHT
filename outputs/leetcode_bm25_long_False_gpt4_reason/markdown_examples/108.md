# Query `108`

## Original Question

*Along a long library corridor, there is a line of seats and decorative plants. You are given a 0-indexed string `corridor` of length `n` consisting of letters `'S'` and `'P'` where each `'S'` represents a seat and each `'P'` represents a plant.

One room divider has already been installed to the left of index `0`, and another to the right of index `n - 1`. Additional room dividers can be installed. For each position between indices `i - 1` and `i` (`1 <= i <= n - 1`), at most one divider can be installed.

Divide the corridor into non-overlapping sections, where each section has exactly two seats with any number of plants. There may be multiple ways to perform the division. Two ways are different if there is a position with a room divider installed in the first way but not in the second way.

Return _the number of ways to divide the corridor_. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`. If there is no way, return `0`.

Example 1:

Input: corridor =  "SSPPSPS "
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 different ways to divide the corridor.
The black bars in the above image indicate the two room dividers already installed.
Note that in each of the ways, each section has exactly two seats.

Example 2:

Input: corridor =  "PPSPSP "
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only 1 way to divide the corridor, by not installing any additional dividers.
Installing any would create some section that does not have exactly two seats.

Example 3:

Input: corridor =  "S "
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to divide the corridor because there will always be a section that does not have exactly two seats.

Constraints:

   `n == corridor.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `corridor[i]` is either `'S'` or `'P'`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find out how many ways you can divide a given corridor, represented by a string, into non-overlapping sections where each section contains exactly two seats ('S') and any number of plants ('P'), given that dividers are already placed at both ends of the corridor. 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Count the Total Seats**: The first step is to iterate through the corridor string to count the total number of seats ('S'). If the total number of seats is not even, return 0 immediately because it's impossible to divide the corridor into sections with exactly two seats each.

2. **Check for No Possible Division**: If the total number of seats is less than 2, it's impossible to divide the corridor according to the given rules, so return 0.

3. **Find Division Possibilities**: Once we have confirmed an even number of seats greater than or equal to 2, we need to find out how many ways we can divide the corridor. The key observation is that dividers can only be placed in positions that ensure each section has exactly two seats. This means a divider can only go after every second seat ('S'). However, the number of ways to place these dividers depends on the number of plants ('P') between pairs of seats.

    - Every time we encounter two seats with plants in between, we have multiple choices for placing a divider. Specifically, if there are `x` plants between a pair of two seats (not considering the first and last pair since dividers are already there), then we can place a divider in `x+1` different positions (either before the first plant, between the plants, or after the last plant).

4. **Calculate the Total Ways**: For each pair of seats after the first one, multiply the number of ways to place the divider by the number of ways calculated so far. This is because each new pair of seats with their preceding plants introduces additional possibilities for division, which multiplies the total number of ways.

5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the number of ways can be very large, calculate the total number of ways modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to keep the number manageable and to meet the requirement of the problem statement.

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all pairs of seats, return the total number of ways calculated.

### Example to Illustrate:

For the corridor "SSPPSPS", the total number of seats is 4, which is even, allowing for possible divisions.

- Between the first and second 'S', there are no 'P's, so no choice here (but it's the start, so it's okay).
- Between the second and third 'S', there are two 'P's, introducing `2+1 = 3` ways to place a divider.
- The last 'S' pair has no 'P' in between, so no additional choices are introduced here.

Hence, there are 3 ways to divide the corridor in the example given, which matches the expected output.

This approach systematically breaks down the problem and provides a clear method to calculate the number of possible ways to divide the corridor, considering all constraints and requirements.
