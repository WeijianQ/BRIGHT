# Query `43`

## Original Question

*There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.

You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the `ith` car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the `ith` car (in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.

Return _the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination_.

Example 1:

Input: target = 12, position = \[10,8,0,5,3\], speed = \[2,4,1,1,3\]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.
The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.
The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.
Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: target = 10, position = \[3\], speed = \[3\]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.

Example 3:

Input: target = 100, position = \[0,2,4\], speed = \[4,2,1\]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.
Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

Constraints:

   `n == position.length == speed.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `0 < target <= 106`
   `0 <= position[i] < target`
   All the values of `position` are unique.
   `0 < speed[i] <= 106`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the number of car fleets that will reach the destination. A car fleet is defined as one or more cars moving together at the same speed and position. The conditions for forming a fleet include cars catching up to each other due to their speed differences but not being able to pass, thus moving together at the speed of the slower car in the fleet. The task involves calculating how many such fleets will form by the time all cars reach the destination.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sort the Cars by Position**: Since cars can only catch up to each other if they are ahead, we need to consider the cars in order of their starting positions relative to the destination. This means sorting the cars based on their starting positions in descending order, so we consider the closest car to the destination first.

2. **Calculate Time to Reach the Destination**: For each car, calculate the time it would take to reach the destination if it did not encounter any slower cars. This is calculated as `(target - position[i]) / speed[i]` for each car `i`. This step is crucial because it allows us to compare the relative speeds of the cars in a way that accounts for their starting positions.

3. **Determine Fleets**: Starting with the car closest to the destination, compare the time it takes for each subsequent car to reach the destination. If a car can reach the destination in less time than the car or fleet in front of it, it will catch up, and they will form a fleet. This means the car or fleet behind adopts the slower time to the destination of the car or fleet in front. If a car cannot catch up, it signifies the start of a new fleet. 

    - To implement this, keep track of the current slowest time to the destination (`currentSlowestTime`). Initially, this is set to the time for the first car (after sorting). Iterate through the cars in sorted order, and for each car, if its time to the destination is more than `currentSlowestTime`, it becomes a new fleet, and `currentSlowestTime` is updated to this car's time. If its time to the destination is less than or equal to `currentSlowestTime`, it joins the current fleet, and no action is needed since it cannot reach faster than the fleet in front of it.

4. **Count Fleets**: Each time a car forms a new fleet (i.e., its time to destination is greater than `currentSlowestTime`), increment a fleet counter. The total number of increments by the end gives the number of fleets.

This approach effectively groups cars into fleets based on their ability to catch up to each other before reaching the destination, considering both their speed and starting positions. The sorting step ensures we always consider cars in the correct order to determine fleet formation accurately, while the iterative comparison of times to the destination accounts for the dynamic nature of fleet formation as cars catch up to each other.

It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.<br>   `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.<br><br>For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet.
