# Query `69`

## Original Question

*In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return _the required force_.

Example 1:

Input: position = \[1,2,3,4,7\], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs \[3, 3, 6\]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.

Example 2:

Input: position = \[5,4,3,2,1,1000000000\], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.

Constraints:

   `n == position.length`
   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
   All integers in `position` are distinct.
   `2 <= m <= position.length`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is a classic one in computer science and optimization, often tackled with a binary search approach to find the maximum minimum distance (or magnetic force, in this context) that can be maintained between any two balls when they are distributed in the baskets. The goal is to maximize the minimum distance between any two balls to ensure the minimum magnetic force between them is as large as possible.

### Key Concepts and Approach

1. **Sorting the Positions**: Since the baskets' positions are given in an arbitrary order and the magnetic force depends on the absolute difference in positions, the first step is to sort the `position` array. This sorting helps in efficiently exploring possible distances (magnetic forces) between the balls.

2. **Binary Search for the Answer**: The problem essentially asks for the largest minimum distance that can be achieved between any two balls. We can use binary search on the answer, i.e., we iteratively guess a minimum distance and check if it's possible to place all `m` balls with at least that distance between any two of them.

3. **Checking Feasibility**: For each guessed distance, we need a function to check if it's possible to place all `m` balls in the baskets such that no two balls have a smaller distance between them than the guessed distance. This involves iterating over the sorted positions and placing balls with the constraint of the current guessed distance.

4. **Binary Search Space**: The search space for the binary search is between 1 (the minimum possible distance) and the difference between the maximum and minimum positions in the `position` array (the maximum possible distance).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Sort** the `position` array to have the baskets in ascending order of their positions.

2. **Initialize** the binary search space: `left` as 1 (minimum distance) and `right` as `position[n-1] - position[0]` (maximum possible distance), where `n` is the number of baskets.

3. **While** `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right` (this is our current guess for the maximum minimum distance).
    - Check if it is possible to place all `m` balls with at least `mid` distance between any two. This involves iterating through the `position` array and placing a ball in a basket if the distance from the previously placed ball is at least `mid`.
    - If it is possible to place all balls with at least `mid` distance, it means we can try for a larger distance, so update `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - If it is not possible, it means `mid` is too large, and we need to try a smaller distance, so update `right` to `mid - 1`.

4. **Return** `right` at the end of the binary search. When the loop exits, `right` will be the largest minimum distance that can be achieved, since the loop narrows down the search to the maximum value that still satisfies the condition of placing all `m` balls.

### Conclusion

This approach, leveraging binary search on the answer space and a greedy method for placement based on the current guess, efficiently finds the maximum minimum magnetic force that can be achieved. It's a beautiful blend of algorithmic techniques that highlights the power of binary search beyond simple array lookups.

However,<br>    most of the solutions suffer from either space or query time that is<br>    exponential in :math:`d`. For large :math:`d`, they often provide little,<br>    if any, improvement over the 'brute_force' method. This is a well-known<br>    consequence of the phenomenon called `The Curse of Dimensionality`.<br><br>    `Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)<br>    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing`_ is an approach<br>    that is designed to efficiently solve the approximate nearest neighbor<br>    search problem for high dimensional data. The key idea of LSH is to hash<br>    the data points using several hash functions, so that the probability of<br>    collision is much higher for data points which are close to each other than<br>    those which are far apart.<br><br>    An LSH family is a family of functions :math:`h` which map points from the<br>    metric space to a bucket, so that<br><br>    - if :math:`d(p, q) \\leq R`, then :math:`h(p) = h(q)` with at least probability :math:`p_1`.<br>    - if :math:`d(p, q) \\geq cR`, then :math:`h(p) = h(q)` with probability at most :math:`p_2`.<br><br>    LSH for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search:<br><br>    - We define a new family of hash functions :math:`g`, where each<br>      function :math:`g` is obtained by concatenating :math:`k` functions<br>      :math:`h_1, ..., h_k`, i.e., :math:`g(p)=[h_1(p),...,h_k(p)]`.<br>      The algorithm constructs :math:`L` hash tables, each of which<br>      corresponds to a different randomly chosen hash function :math:`g`.<br>      There are :math:`k \\cdot L` hash functions used in total.<br><br>    - In the preprocessing step, we hash all :math:`n` reference points<br>      into each of the :math:`L` hash tables.<br><br>    - Given a query point :math:`q`, the algorithm iterates over the<br>      :math:`L` hash functions :math:`g`. For each :math:`g` considered, it<br>      retrieves the data points that are hashed into the same bucket as q.<br>      These data points from all the :math:`L` hash tables are considered as<br>      candidates that are then re-ranked by their real distances with the query<br>      data.<br><br>    Note that the number of tables :math:`L` and the number of hash<br>    functions per table :math:`k` are two main parameters.

We set :math:`r` using the average all-pair `euclidean`<br>      distances from a small randomly sampled subset of the reference data.<br><br>    - `manhattan`: The hash function of `manhattan` is similar with that of<br>      `euclidean`. The only difference is that the elements of `a` are sampled<br>      from Cauchy distribution, instead of normal distribution.<br><br>    - `cosine`: Random Projection is designed to approximate the cosine<br>      distance between vectors. The hash function is :math:`h(q) = sgn(a \\cdot<br>      q)`, where :math:`a` is randomly sampled normal unit vector.<br><br>    - `jaccard`: We use a recently proposed method one permutation hashing by<br>      Shrivastava and Li.
