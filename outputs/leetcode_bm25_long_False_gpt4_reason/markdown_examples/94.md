# Query `94`

## Original Question

*There are `n` points on a road you are driving your taxi on. The `n` points on the road are labeled from `1` to `n` in the direction you are going, and you want to drive from point `1` to point `n` to make money by picking up passengers. You cannot change the direction of the taxi.

The passengers are represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array `rides`, where `rides[i] = [starti, endi, tipi]` denotes the `ith` passenger requesting a ride from point `starti` to point `endi` who is willing to give a `tipi` dollar tip.

For each passenger `i` you pick up, you earn `endi - starti + tipi` dollars. You may only drive at most one passenger at a time.

Given `n` and `rides`, return _the maximum number of dollars you can earn by picking up the passengers optimally._

Note: You may drop off a passenger and pick up a different passenger at the same point.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, rides = \[\[2,5,4\],\[1,5,1\]\]
Output: 7
Explanation: We can pick up passenger 0 to earn 5 - 2 + 4 = 7 dollars.

Example 2:

Input: n = 20, rides = \[\[1,6,1\],\[3,10,2\],\[10,12,3\],\[11,12,2\],\[12,15,2\],\[13,18,1\]\]
Output: 20
Explanation: We will pick up the following passengers:
- Drive passenger 1 from point 3 to point 10 for a profit of 10 - 3 + 2 = 9 dollars.
- Drive passenger 2 from point 10 to point 12 for a profit of 12 - 10 + 3 = 5 dollars.
- Drive passenger 5 from point 13 to point 18 for a profit of 18 - 13 + 1 = 6 dollars.
We earn 9 + 5 + 6 = 20 dollars in total.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= rides.length <= 3  104`
   `rides[i].length == 3`
   `1 <= starti < endi <= n`
   `1 <= tipi <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is an optimization one, where the goal is to maximize earnings by choosing a subset of passengers to drive, under the constraints that you can only carry one passenger at a time and must drive in a single direction from point 1 to point n. This problem can be approached as a dynamic programming problem, where the state represents the maximum earnings that can be achieved up to each point on the road.

### Key Concepts and Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** We can use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum earnings that can be achieved by reaching point `i` on the road. The initial state `dp[0]` would be 0, as no money is earned without driving any passengers.

2. **Sorting Rides:** First, sort the rides based on their end points. This ensures that when processing rides to update the DP array, we are always moving forward along the road, aligning with the problem's constraint of not changing the taxi's direction.

3. **Updating DP States:** For each ride from `starti` to `endi` with a tip of `tipi`, the profit earned from this ride is `endi - starti + tipi`. To update the DP array, we consider taking this ride and compare it with not taking the ride:
   - If taking the ride, the total earnings would be the sum of the earnings before picking up this passenger (`dp[starti]`) and the earnings from this ride (`endi - starti + tipi`).
   - Update `dp[endi]` if this sum is greater than the current value of `dp[endi]`, which represents the maximum earnings by the time we reach `endi`.

4. **Handling Multiple Rides Ending at the Same Point:** Since rides are sorted by their end points, there might be multiple rides ending at the same point but starting from different points. We must ensure that `dp[endi]` reflects the maximum possible earnings by reaching that point, considering all possible rides ending there.

5. **Binary Search for Efficiency:** To quickly find the maximum earnings before starting a new ride, we can use binary search on the sorted rides or directly access the DP array if the rides are processed in order. This optimization is crucial for handling large input sizes efficiently.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initialization:** Create a DP array of size `n+1` (considering 1-indexed road points) with all elements initialized to 0.

2. **Sort Rides:** Sort the `rides` array based on the end points of the rides.

3. **Iterate and Update DP:** For each ride in the sorted `rides` array, calculate the potential earnings from taking the ride. Update the DP array to reflect the maximum earnings up to the end point of the current ride.

4. **Final Answer:** The maximum earnings achievable by the time you reach point `n` would be stored in `dp[n]`.

### Conclusion:

By following this approach, you can efficiently compute the maximum earnings possible by picking up passengers optimally. This problem exemplifies the utility of dynamic programming in solving optimization problems with overlapping subproblems and the importance of sorting and efficient state updating in DP solutions.

> def slowestKey(releaseTimes, keysPressed):<br>    """You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.<br><br>You can only attend one event at a time.
