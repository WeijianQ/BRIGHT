# Query `99`

## Original Question

*You want to water `n` plants in your garden with a watering can. The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where the `ith` plant is located at `x = i`. There is a river at `x = -1` that you can refill your watering can at.

Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You will water the plants in the following way:

   Water the plants in order from left to right.
   After watering the current plant, if you do not have enough water to completely water the next plant, return to the river to fully refill the watering can.
   You cannot refill the watering can early.

You are initially at the river (i.e., `x = -1`). It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and an integer `capacity` representing the watering can capacity, return _the number of steps needed to water all the plants_.

Example 1:

Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacity = 5
Output: 14
Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
- Walk to plant 0 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 3 units of water.
- Walk to plant 1 (1 step) and water it. Watering can has 1 unit of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 2, walk back to the river to refill (2 steps).
- Walk to plant 2 (3 steps) and water it. Watering can has 2 units of water.
- Since you cannot completely water plant 3, walk back to the river to refill (3 steps).
- Walk to plant 3 (4 steps) and water it.
Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14.

Example 2:

Input: plants = \[1,1,1,4,2,3\], capacity = 4
Output: 30
Explanation: Start at the river with a full watering can:
- Water plants 0, 1, and 2 (3 steps). Return to river (3 steps).
- Water plant 3 (4 steps). Return to river (4 steps).
- Water plant 4 (5 steps). Return to river (5 steps).
- Water plant 5 (6 steps).
Steps needed = 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 30.

Example 3:

Input: plants = \[7,7,7,7,7,7,7\], capacity = 8
Output: 49
Explanation: You have to refill before watering each plant.
Steps needed = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 49.

Constraints:

   `n == plants.length`
   `1 <= n <= 1000`
   `1 <= plants[i] <= 106`
   `max(plants[i]) <= capacity <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the minimum number of steps required to water all the plants in a garden, given the capacity of the watering can and the amount of water each plant needs. To solve this problem, there are several key points to consider:

1. **Initial Position**: You start at the river, located at `x = -1`.
2. **Movement**: You move along a straight line where each plant is located one unit apart, and it takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis.
3. **Watering Can Capacity**: The watering can has a fixed capacity, and you can only refill it at the river when it's empty or doesn't have enough water to fully water the next plant.
4. **Watering Plants**: Plants are watered in a left-to-right sequence, and you must have enough water to completely water a plant. If not, you must return to the river to refill the watering can.
5. **Steps Calculation**: The number of steps includes both moving between plants and returning to the river to refill the watering can.

To calculate the total number of steps, we can follow these steps:

- Start at the river with a full watering can.
- Move towards the first plant. This takes 1 step (since the first plant is at `x = 0` and you start at `x = -1`).
- For each plant:
  - If you have enough water to water the plant, do so and move to the next plant (1 step).
  - If you don't have enough water, return to the river to refill and then move to the plant you need to water next. The number of steps to return to the river is equal to the current position (`i + 1` since your position is one more than the index of the plant you just watered or attempted to water), and you'll take the same number of steps to get back to the next plant.
- Repeat this process until all plants are watered.

**Example 1 Analysis**:
- The capacity of the watering can is 5 units.
- Moving to plant 0 and watering it consumes 2 units of water, leaving 3 units.
- Moving to plant 1 and watering it consumes another 2 units, leaving 1 unit, which is not enough for plant 2.
- Return to the river to refill (2 steps back), then move to plant 2 (3 steps forward) and water it.
- Similarly, for plant 3, return to refill and then move to water it.
- The total steps are calculated as described in the example: 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 14 steps.

**General Solution**:
To implement a solution, you can simulate this process, keeping track of the current position, the amount of water left in the can, and the total steps taken. For each plant, check if you have enough water to water it. If not, calculate the steps needed to return and refill, then proceed to water the plant. This approach ensures you only refill when necessary and efficiently calculates the total steps needed to water all plants.

This problem combines elements of simulation and careful management of resources (water in this case) to achieve an objective (watering all plants) with the least number of steps (efficiency).

> def hurst_rs(data, nvals=None, fit="RANSAC", debug_plot=False,<br>             debug_data=False, plot_file=None, corrected=True, unbiased=True):<br>  """<br>  Calculates the Hurst exponent by a standard rescaled range (R/S) approach.<br><br>  Explanation of Hurst exponent:<br>    The Hurst exponent is a measure for the "long-term memory" of a<br>    time series, meaning the long statistical dependencies in the data that do<br>    not originate from cycles.<br><br>    It originates from H.E. Hursts observations of the problem of long-term<br>    storage in water reservoirs. If x_i is the discharge of a river in year i<br>    and we observe this discharge for N years, we can calculate the storage<br>    capacity that would be required to keep the discharge steady at its mean<br>    value.<br><br>    To do so, we first substract the mean over all x_i from the individual<br>    x_i to obtain the departures x'_i from the mean for each year i. As the<br>    excess or deficit in discharge always carrys over from year i to year i+1,<br>    we need to examine the cumulative sum of x'_i, denoted by y_i. This<br>    cumulative sum represents the filling of our hypothetical storage. If the<br>    sum is above 0, we are storing excess discharge from the river, if it is<br>    below zero we have compensated a deficit in discharge by releasing<br>    water from the storage. The range (maximum - minimum) R of y_i therefore<br>    represents the total capacity required for the storage.<br><br>    Hurst showed that this value follows a steady trend for varying N if it<br>    is normalized by the standard deviation sigma over the x_i. Namely he<br>    obtained the following formula:<br><br>    R/sigma = (N/2)^K<br><br>    In this equation, K is called the Hurst exponent. Its value is 0.5 for<br>    white noise, but becomes greater for time series that exhibit some positive<br>    dependency on previous values. For negative dependencies it becomes less<br>    than 0.5.<br><br>  Explanation of the algorithm:<br>    The rescaled range (R/S) approach is directly derived from Hurst's<br>    definition. The time series of length N is split into non-overlapping<br>    subseries of length n. Then, R and S (S = sigma) are calculated for each<br>    subseries and the mean is taken over all subseries yielding (R/S)_n. This<br>    process is repeated for several lengths n. Finally, the exponent K is<br>    obtained by fitting a straight line to the plot of log((R/S)_n) vs log(n).<br><br>    There seems to be no consensus how to chose the subseries lenghts n.<br>    This function therefore leaves the choice to the user.

Unless otherwise stated they use the divisors<br>             of the length of the sequence as n. The length is reduced by at<br>             most 1% to find the value that has the most divisors.<br><br>              The "Simple R/S" estimate is just log((R/S)_n) / log(n) for <br>               n = N.<br>              The "theoretical Hurst exponent" is the value that would be<br>               expected of an uncorrected rescaled range approach for random<br>               noise of the size of the input data.<br>              The "empirical Hurst exponent" is the uncorrected Hurst exponent<br>               obtained by the rescaled range approach.<br>              The "corrected empirical Hurst exponent" is the Anis-Lloyd-Peters<br>               corrected Hurst exponent, but with sqrt(1/2  pi  n) added to<br>               the (R/S)_n before the log.<br>              The "corrected R over S Hurst exponent" uses the R-function "lm"<br>               instead of pracmas own "polyfit" and uses n = N/2, N/4, N/8, ...<br>               by successively halving the subsequences (which means that some<br>               subsequences may be one element longer than others).

Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:<br><br>   Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the `0th` plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the `(n - 1)th` plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.<br>   It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.<br>   Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.<br>   In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.<br><br>Given a 0-indexed integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and two integers `capacityA` and `capacityB` representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return _the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants_.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation:<br>- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.<br>- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.<br>- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.<br>- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4<br>Output: 2<br>Explanation:<br>- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.<br>- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.<br>- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.<br>- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.<br><br>Example 3:<br><br>Input: plants = \[5\], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8<br>Output: 0<br>Explanation:<br>- There is only one plant.<br>- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `n == plants.length`<br>   `1 <= n <= 105`<br>   `1 <= plants[i] <= 106`<br>   `max(plants[i]) <= capacityA, capacityB <= 109`"""<br><br>    MOD = 109 + 7<br><br>    def is_prime(n: int) - bool:<br>        if n <= 1:<br>            return False<br>        for i in range(2, int(n0.5) + 1):<br>            if n % i == 0:<br>                return False<br>        return True<br><br>    primes = [i for i in range(2, 91) if is_prime(i)]<br>    cnt = [0]  100<br>    for n in nums:<br>        cnt[n] += 1<br><br>    dp = [0]  (1 << 20)<br>    dp[0] = 1<br>    <br>    for i in range(30, 0, -1):<br>        if cnt[i] == 0:<br>            continue<br>        mask = [j for j in primes if i % j == 0]<br>        i = i // j<br>        if i  1:<br>            continue<br><br>        m = 0<br>        for j in mask:<br>            m |= 1 << (j - 2)<br><br>        for j in range(len(dp)-1, -1, -1):<br>            if dp[j] == 0:<br>                continue<br>            cur = 1<br>            for k in range(cnt[m]):<br>                cur = (cur  2) % MOD<br>                dp[j | m] = (dp[j | m] + dp[j]  cur) % MOD<br><br>    ans = sum(dp) % MOD<br>    ans = (ans - dp[0] + MOD) % MOD<br>    return (ans  (1 << (cnt[1] - 1))) % MOD
