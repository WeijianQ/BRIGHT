# Query `37`

## Original Question

*You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position `target`.

You can make some number of moves `numMoves` so that:

   On each move, you can either go left or right.
   During the `ith` move (starting from `i == 1` to `i == numMoves`), you take `i` steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer `target`, return _the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum_ `numMoves`_) to reach the destination_.

Example 1:

Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).

Example 2:

Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).

Constraints:

   `-109 <= target <= 109`
   `target != 0`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum number of steps required to reach a specific target position on an infinite number line, starting from position `0`. With each move `i`, you can move `i` steps either to the left or to the right. This creates a sequence of incremental steps, where the distance you can cover increases with each move. The challenge is to figure out the most efficient way to use these incremental steps to reach the target position.

### Key Considerations

1. **Direction of Movement**: It doesn't matter if the target is to the left or right (negative or positive) because the minimum number of moves to reach a positive target is the same as to reach its negative counterpart due to symmetry. Therefore, we can consider the target as always being positive to simplify the problem.

2. **Sum of Moves**: The sum of the first `n` moves is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2`. This sum grows quadratically with `n` and will eventually surpass any given target. The challenge is to find the smallest `n` for which this sum is equal to or just surpasses the target.

3. **Overshooting the Target**: If the sum of moves overshoots the target, the excess must be even to adjust the direction of the moves to reach the target precisely. This is because, with each move, changing direction (going left instead of right for one step or vice versa) adjusts the total sum by an even number (2 steps difference for every change in direction).

### Solving the Problem

1. **Find the minimum `n` such that `n*(n+1)/2 >= target`**: Start with `n = 1` and keep increasing `n` until the sum of the first `n` moves is at least the absolute value of the target. This step finds a potential number of moves that could reach or surpass the target.

2. **Check for the ability to adjust**: Once a potential `n` is found, check if the sum overshoots the target and by how much. If the difference (`sum - target`) is even, you can adjust the directions of the steps within those `n` moves to reach the target exactly. If the difference is odd, you need to keep increasing `n` until the difference becomes even, which might involve considering the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and how it affects the ability to make such adjustments.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Example 1**: Target = 2
    - Step 1: 1 step right, total = 1
    - Step 2: 2 steps left, total = -1
    - Step 3: 3 steps right, total = 2
    - Minimum moves = 3

- **Example 2**: Target = 3
    - Step 1: 1 step right, total = 1
    - Step 2: 2 steps right, total = 3
    - Minimum moves = 2

### Implementation Note

In terms of implementation, this problem can be solved efficiently in O(1) or O(log(target)) time complexity, depending on the approach to find `n`. A simple while loop increasing `n` until the conditions are met is a straightforward approach, but more mathematically sophisticated methods can reduce the number of iterations needed to find the solution.

The key is understanding the quadratic growth of the sum of moves and leveraging the evenness of the overshoot to determine when you can precisely reach or adjust to the target.

The default is 'bilinear'.<br>        linear : bool, optional<br>            The semimajor axis growing/shrinking mode. If `False`<br>            (default), the geometric growing mode is chosen, thus the<br>            semimajor axis length is increased by a factor of (1. +<br>            ``step``), and the process is repeated until either the<br>            semimajor axis value reaches the value of parameter<br>            ``maxsma``, or the last fitted ellipse has more than a given<br>            fraction of its sampled points flagged out (see ``fflag``).<br>            The process then resumes from the first fitted ellipse (at<br>            ``sma0``) inwards, in steps of (1./(1. + ``step``)), until<br>            the semimajor axis length reaches the value ``minsma``. In<br>            case of linear growing, the increment or decrement value is<br>            given directly by ``step`` in pixels.  If ``maxsma`` is set<br>            to `None`, the semimajor axis will grow until a low<br>            signal-to-noise criterion is met. See ``maxgerr``.<br>        maxrit : float or `None`, optional<br>            The maximum value of semimajor axis to perform an actual<br>            fit.  Whenever the current semimajor axis length is larger<br>            than ``maxrit``, the isophotes will be extracted using the<br>            current geometry, without being fitted.  This non-iterative<br>            mode may be useful for sampling regions of very low surface<br>            brightness, where the algorithm may become unstable and<br>            unable to recover reliable geometry information.<br>            Non-iterative mode can also be entered automatically<br>            whenever the ellipticity exceeds 1.0 or the ellipse center<br>            crosses the image boundaries.
