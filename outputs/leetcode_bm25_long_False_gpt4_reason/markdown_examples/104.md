# Query `104`

## Original Question

*Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti]` depicts `amounti` fruits at the position `positioni`. `fruits` is already sorted by `positioni` in ascending order, and each `positioni` is unique.

You are also given an integer `startPos` and an integer `k`. Initially, you are at the position `startPos`. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most `k` steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.

Return _the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest_.

Example 1:

Input: fruits = \[\[2,8\],\[6,3\],\[8,6\]\], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.

Example 2:

Input: fruits = \[\[0,9\],\[4,1\],\[5,7\],\[6,2\],\[7,4\],\[10,9\]\], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.

Example 3:

Input: fruits = \[\[0,3\],\[6,4\],\[8,5\]\], startPos = 3, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.

Constraints:

   `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
   `fruits[i].length == 2`
   `0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2  105`
   `positioni-1 < positioni` for any `i > 0` (0-indexed)
   `1 <= amounti <= 104`
   `0 <= k <= 2  105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to maximize the number of fruits collected by moving at most `k` steps in either direction from a starting position on an infinite x-axis, where fruits are placed at certain positions in a sorted manner. To address this, we need to consider the distribution of fruits relative to the starting position and the constraint on the number of steps we can take (`k`). The problem requires an efficient strategy to decide in which direction to move and how far, to collect the maximum possible number of fruits within the given step limit.

### Key Considerations:

1. **Understanding Movement and Collection**: Since you can move up to `k` steps in total and collect fruits at each position you reach, the strategy involves deciding the initial direction of movement (left or right) and how to maximize the collection by possibly changing direction within the limit of steps.

2. **Evaluating Reachable Positions**: Given the starting position and the maximum number of steps, the first step is to filter out the positions that are unreachable so that we only consider positions within `startPos - k` to `startPos + k`.

3. **Strategy for Maximizing Fruits**:
   - **Single Direction Movement**: Calculate the total number of fruits that can be collected by moving only in one direction (either all steps to the left or all to the right) within the step limit.
   - **Two-Direction Movement**: Consider scenarios where moving in one direction first and then reversing direction might yield a higher fruit count. This involves complex considerations such as the distance between fruit positions, the number of fruits at each position, and the remaining steps after the initial direction of movement.

4. **Dynamic Approach**: While a greedy approach (always moving towards the position with the highest number of fruits within reach) seems intuitive, it might not always yield the best solution due to step constraints and distribution of fruits. A dynamic approach or a two-pointer technique could be useful for evaluating different scenarios and combinations of movements.

5. **Edge Cases**: Pay attention to edge cases such as when the fruits are all located in positions beyond the reach given the `k` steps limitation or when the optimal path involves collecting fruits from a minimal number of positions due to their fruit abundance.

### Solution Sketch:

1. **Preprocessing**: Start by filtering out all fruit positions that are not reachable with the given `k` steps. This simplifies the problem space.

2. **Calculate Maximum Fruits Without Changing Direction**: Iterate through the list of reachable fruit positions and calculate the total fruits that can be collected by moving in a single direction without changing course. Do this for both left and right directions from the starting position.

3. **Calculate Maximum Fruits With Direction Change**: Consider every possible point of changing direction within the reachable area. For each potential pivot, calculate the total fruits that can be collected by moving in one direction, changing direction at the pivot, and then moving in the opposite direction, all within the step limit.

4. **Compare and Determine the Maximum**: Compare the totals from the single direction movements and the best case of two-direction movement to find the overall maximum fruits that can be collected.

5. **Return the Result**: The maximum number identified from these strategies represents the solution to the problem.

Implementing this approach requires careful coding, especially for the part where you evaluate the benefit of changing direction. This involves not just simple iteration but a nuanced understanding of how far you can go in one direction before it becomes more beneficial to reverse course to collect more fruits, all while keeping an eye on the total step count constraint.
