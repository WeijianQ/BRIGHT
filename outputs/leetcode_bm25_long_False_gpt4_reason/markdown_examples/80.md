# Query `80`

## Original Question

*You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events._

Example 1:

Input: events = \[\[1,2,4\],\[3,4,3\],\[2,3,1\]\], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:

Input: events = \[\[1,2,4\],\[3,4,3\],\[2,3,10\]\], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k events.

Example 3:

Input: events = \[\[1,1,1\],\[2,2,2\],\[3,3,3\],\[4,4,4\]\], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest valued three.

Constraints:

   `1 <= k <= events.length`
   `1 <= k  events.length <= 106`
   `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109`
   `1 <= valuei <= 106`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is an optimization problem that involves selecting a subset of non-overlapping events from a given set, such that the sum of the values of these selected events is maximized, and the number of selected events does not exceed a given limit `k`. This problem can be approached using dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, considering the constraints and properties of the events.

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Non-overlapping Events**: Since you can attend only one event at a time and must attend the entire event, any two events you choose to attend must not overlap in time.

2. **Event Value Maximization**: Among the non-overlapping events you can attend, you want to maximize the sum of their values.

3. **Limit on Number of Events**: You can attend at most `k` events, which adds a constraint to the selection process.

### Approach:

A dynamic programming approach could effectively address this problem, considering the constraints and the goal of maximizing the total value. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of a potential approach:

#### Step 1: Sort Events

First, sort the events based on their start time. This ordering will help to dynamically build up solutions by considering one event at a time in chronological order.

#### Step 2: Use Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming (DP) can be used to keep track of the maximum value that can be achieved by attending a certain number of events up to a certain day. A 2D DP array can be used, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained by attending `i` events up to day `j`.

#### Step 3: Update DP Table

Iterate through the sorted events, and for each event, update the DP table. For each event `e`, consider all possible numbers of attended events from `1` to `k`. For each possible number of attended events, compare the value of attending this event (plus the maximum value obtained by attending fewer events before this event's start day) with not attending it. Update the DP table with the maximum value.

#### Step 4: Handle Overlapping Events

While updating the DP table, ensure that attending a new event does not conflict with an already attended event. This involves checking that the start day of the new event is after the end day of the last attended event for the previous number of attended events.

#### Step 5: Find the Maximum Value

After filling the DP table, the maximum sum of values for attending up to `k` events can be found by looking at the maximum value in the row corresponding to attending `k` events.

### Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach would largely depend on the number of events `n` and the maximum number of events `k`. Sorting the events would take `O(n log n)`. The dynamic programming part would take `O(nk)`, considering you iterate through all events and for each event, you iterate through all possible numbers of attended events up to `k`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity would be `O(nk)` for the DP table.

### Conclusion:

This problem requires careful consideration of event scheduling constraints to maximize the total value of attended events within the limit of `k` events. A dynamic programming approach, with careful handling of event overlaps and maximization conditions, provides a structured way to find the optimal solution.
