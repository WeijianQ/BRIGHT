# Query `50`

## Original Question

*Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:

Input: points = \[\[1,3\],\[-2,2\]\], k = 1
Output: \[\[-2,2\]\]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just \[\[-2,2\]\].

Example 2:

Input: points = \[\[3,3\],\[5,-1\],\[-2,4\]\], k = 2
Output: \[\[3,3\],\[-2,4\]\]
Explanation: The answer \[\[-2,4\],\[3,3\]\] would also be accepted.

Constraints:

   `1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`
   `-104 < xi, yi < 104`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)` from a given array of points on the X-Y plane. The solution requires calculating the Euclidean distance for each point from the origin, then sorting these points based on their distances, and finally selecting the top `k` points with the smallest distances.

### Step by Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Euclidean Distance for Each Point:**
   - The Euclidean distance of a point `(xi, yi)` from the origin `(0, 0)` is given by `sqrt((xi - 0)^2 + (yi - 0)^2)`, which simplifies to `sqrt(xi^2 + yi^2)`.
   - For each point in the array, calculate its distance from the origin using the above formula. This can be done in a loop where each iteration computes the distance for one point.

2. **Store Points with Their Distances:**
   - While calculating distances, store them in a way that keeps the association with their respective points. This could be done by creating tuples or pairs where the first element is the distance and the second element is the point, or by using a dictionary if a direct association is more suitable.

3. **Sort Points by Distance:**
   - Sort the list of points based on their calculated distances from the origin. Since the points are associated with their distances, sorting them by distance effectively sorts the points themselves in order of closeness to the origin.

4. **Select the Top `k` Points:**
   - After sorting, the first `k` points in the list are the closest to the origin. Select these points to form the final answer. This can be done by slicing the sorted list up to `k` elements.

5. **Return the Answer:**
   - The selected `k` closest points to the origin are returned as the final result. The problem statement allows for the answer to be in any order, so no further sorting is necessary based on the points' original positions or values.

### Relevant Information:

- **Euclidean Distance Calculation:** It's crucial to correctly calculate the Euclidean distance, as it determines the sorting and ultimately the answer.
- **Sorting Efficiency:** Since the problem involves sorting, the efficiency of the sorting algorithm could impact performance, especially for large datasets.
- **Data Structures:** Choosing the right data structure to associate points with their distances is key for efficient sorting and selection.
- **Constraint Handling:** The constraints provided (e.g., `1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`, `-104 < xi, yi < 104`) suggest that the solution needs to handle potentially large inputs efficiently.

By following these steps, the solution efficiently identifies and returns the `k` closest points to the origin from a given array of points on the X-Y plane, adhering to the problem's requirements and constraints.
