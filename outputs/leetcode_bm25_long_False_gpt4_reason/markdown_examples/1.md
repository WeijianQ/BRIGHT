# Query `1`

## Original Question

*The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return _all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle_. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: \[\[ ".Q.. ", "...Q ", "Q... ", "..Q. "\],\[ "..Q. ", "Q... ", "...Q ", ".Q.. "\]\]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: \[\[ "Q "\]\]

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 9`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
To solve the n-queens puzzle, we need to understand the constraints of the problem and devise a systematic way to explore possible solutions that meet these constraints. The essential problem is placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move any number of squares along a row, column, or diagonal. Therefore, the placement must ensure that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints

1. **Row and Column Constraint:** No two queens can occupy the same row or column.
2. **Diagonal Constraint:** No two queens can be on the same diagonal. This means the absolute difference between the columns of any two queens cannot be the same as the absolute difference between their rows.

### Step 2: Backtracking Algorithm

A common approach to solving the n-queens puzzle is using a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is a recursive, depth-first search algorithm that tries to find a solution to a problem by trying one path, and if that path doesn't lead to a solution, it backs up and tries another path.

#### Steps in the Algorithm:

1. **Start in the first row:** Choose a row to start, typically the first row.
2. **Place a Queen:** Try placing a queen in each column of the current row, one at a time, and check if it's a safe placement.
   - To check if the placement is safe, we ensure that there's no queen in the same column, and no queen on the same diagonal. This can be done by maintaining arrays that keep track of the columns and diagonals already occupied by queens.
3. **Recursion:** If a safe placement is found, move to the next row and attempt to place another queen.
4. **Backtrack if needed:** If no safe placement can be found for the next queen, backtrack by removing the last placed queen and trying a new position for it.
5. **Solution Found:** If a queen is successfully placed in the last row, a solution is found. Record the solution and backtrack to find more solutions.

### Step 3: Recording Solutions

Each solution can be represented as a 2D array or a list of strings, where 'Q' represents a queen and '.' represents an empty space. For an efficient representation, we can maintain an array where the index represents the row, and the value at each index represents the queen's column. This array can then be converted into the required format once a solution is complete.

### Step 4: Implementation

Implementing this algorithm requires careful consideration of how to efficiently check for safe placements (especially for diagonals) and how to backtrack correctly to explore all possible solutions. 

- To check diagonals efficiently, note that for any two positions (r1, c1) and (r2, c2), if `|r1 - r2| == |c1 - c2|`, they are on the same diagonal.
- To backtrack, use recursion and make sure to undo any changes (like removing a queen) before trying a new path.

### Step 5: Return All Solutions

After exploring all possible board configurations using the backtracking method, return all the solutions found. The solutions must be formatted according to the problem's requirements before being returned.

This problem requires understanding recursion, backtracking, and how to efficiently check the constraints specific to the n-queens problem. Implementing the solution in code would involve a function that recursively tries to place queens on the board, backtracks upon encountering a dead-end, and records solutions as they are found.
