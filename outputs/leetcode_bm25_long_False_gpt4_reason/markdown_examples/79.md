# Query `79`

## Original Question

*A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.

The environment is represented by a `grid` of size `rows x cols`, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

   Players are represented by the characters `'C'`(Cat)`,'M'`(Mouse).
   Floors are represented by the character `'.'` and can be walked on.
   Walls are represented by the character `'#'` and cannot be walked on.
   Food is represented by the character `'F'` and can be walked on.
   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

   Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
   During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the `grid`.
   `catJump, mouseJump` are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
   Staying in the same position is allowed.
   Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

   If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
   If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
   If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
   If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` and two integers `catJump` and `mouseJump`, return `true` _if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return_ `false`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[ "####F ", "#C... ", "M.... "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[ "M.C...F "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: grid = \[ "M.C...F "\], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 3
Output: false

Constraints:

   `rows == grid.length`
   `cols = grid[i].length`
   `1 <= rows, cols <= 8`
   `grid[i][j]` consist only of characters `'C'`, `'M'`, `'F'`, `'.'`, and `'#'`.
   There is only one of each character `'C'`, `'M'`, and `'F'` in `grid`.
   `1 <= catJump, mouseJump <= 8`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine whether the Mouse can win the game under optimal play conditions from both the Cat and the Mouse, given the specific rules of movement, environment constraints (walls, floor, food), and win conditions. This involves strategic planning, foreseeing possible future moves, and considering all possible outcomes based on the given jumps and the structure of the grid. 

To address this question in detail, let's consider the relevant information and steps that could be helpful:

1. **Grid Analysis**: First, we need to analyze the grid to identify the positions of the Cat, Mouse, and Food. This will help us understand the starting conditions.

2. **Movement Capabilities**: Understanding the movement capabilities of both the Cat and Mouse is crucial. The Mouse moves first and can jump over the Cat, but neither can jump over walls. The difference in their jump lengths can significantly impact the strategy.

3. **Pathfinding**: Both the Cat and Mouse will aim to reach the Food, but the Mouse will also try to avoid the Cat. We need to consider the possible paths to the Food for both characters, taking into account their jump lengths and obstacles.

4. **Win Conditions Analysis**: We need to evaluate the conditions under which the Mouse wins:
   - Reaching the Food first.
   - Avoiding the Cat for 1000 turns if reaching the Food is not immediately possible.

   Similarly, we evaluate how the Cat could win:
   - Catching the Mouse.
   - Reaching the Food first.
   - Preventing the Mouse from reaching the Food within 1000 turns.

5. **Simulating Optimal Play**: This involves considering each player's best move at every turn. The Mouse tries to reach the Food while evading the Cat, and the Cat tries to catch the Mouse or reach the Food first. This step requires simulating the game for many possible moves, considering the strategic depth of "jumping less than the maximum length" and "staying in the same position."

6. **Turn Limit**: The 1000 turns limit introduces a time constraint that can significantly affect strategy, especially in a scenario where the Mouse is evading the Cat without a clear path to the Food.

7. **Recursive Analysis or Dynamic Programming**: Given the complexity, a recursive solution with memoization or a dynamic programming approach could be useful for exploring all possible game states and determining the outcome. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., can the Mouse reach a certain position without the Cat catching it?) and combining these results to solve the larger problem.

For the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: The Mouse has a higher jump capability and can reach the Food without the Cat being able to catch it or reach the Food first. Thus, Mouse wins under optimal play.
- **Example 2**: With a significant jump advantage, the Mouse can easily reach the Food first, ensuring a win.
- **Example 3**: The decrease in Mouse's jump capability means it might not reach the Food before the Cat intercepts or reaches the Food itself, under optimal play from the Cat.

In summary, solving this problem involves a detailed analysis of the grid, strategic movement based on jump capabilities, and considering all possible outcomes under the win conditions. A solution would likely involve simulating the game for various scenarios, possibly using recursion or dynamic programming to efficiently explore the game's state space.

> import random<br>    """A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.<br><br>The graph is given as follows: `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `ab` is an edge of the graph.<br><br>The mouse starts at node `1` and goes first, the cat starts at node `2` and goes second, and there is a hole at node `0`.<br><br>During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph that meets where they are. For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in `graph[1]`.<br><br>Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)<br><br>Then, the game can end in three ways:<br><br>   If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.<br>   If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.<br>   If ever a position is repeated (i.e., the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and it is the same player's turn to move), the game is a draw.<br><br>Given a `graph`, and assuming both players play optimally, return<br><br>   `1` if the mouse wins the game,<br>   `2` if the cat wins the game, or<br>   `0` if the game is a draw.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: graph = \[\[2,5\],\[3\],\[0,4,5\],\[1,4,5\],\[2,3\],\[0,2,3\]\]<br>Output: 0<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: graph = \[\[1,3\],\[0\],\[3\],\[0,2\]\]<br>Output: 1<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `3 <= graph.length <= 50`<br>   `1 <= graph[i].length < graph.length`<br>   `0 <= graph[i][j] < graph.length`<br>   `graph[i][j] != i`<br>   `graph[i]` is unique.<br>   The mouse and the cat can always move."""<br><br><br>class Solution:<br>    def __init__(self, m, n):<br>        self.grid = [[0]  n for _ in range(m)]<br>        self.zero_count = m  n<br><br>    def pick(self):<br>        index = random.randrange(self.zero_count)<br><br>        for i, row in enumerate(self.grid):<br>            for j, cell in enumerate(row):<br>                if cell == 0:<br>                    if index == 0:<br>                        self.grid[i][j] = 1<br>                        self.zero_count -= 1<br>                        return (i, j)<br>                    index -= 1<br>        return (-1, -1)  # Should not happen
