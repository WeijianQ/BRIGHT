# Query `67`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a _move_ consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).

Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine if Alice, who makes the first move, can win the game by optimally removing a square number of stones from the pile such that Bob, playing optimally as well, is eventually forced into a position where he cannot make a move. This problem can be addressed through dynamic programming or game theory by evaluating the win/lose state of each possible number of stones in the pile.

### Key Considerations:

1. **Optimal Play**: Both players are playing optimally, meaning they will make the move that maximizes their chances of winning if such a move exists.
2. **Square Numbers**: Players can only remove square numbers of stones (1, 4, 9, 16, ...).
3. **Win-Lose Conditions**: A player loses if they cannot make a move (i.e., there are no stones left or no square number of stones can be removed).

### Step by Step Analysis:

1. **Base Cases**: 
    - If `n = 1`, Alice wins by removing the only stone.
    - If `n = 2`, Alice loses because after her move, Bob will always have a move to remove the remaining stone.

2. **Recursive/Subproblem Insight**:
    - For any `n`, if Alice can make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position (i.e., a position from which no winning move exists), then Alice can win.
    - Conversely, if every possible move Alice can make leaves Bob in a winning position, Alice will lose.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - We can define a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1`, where `dp[i]` is `true` if the player whose turn is to move can win given `i` stones, and `false` otherwise.
    - Fill the base cases: `dp[0] = false` (no stones to remove, so the player loses), and `dp[1] = true` (removing 1 stone wins the game).
    - Iterate from `2` to `n`, for each `i`, check all square numbers `j*j` where `j*j <= i`. If for any `j`, `dp[i - j*j]` is `false`, it means the player can move to a losing position for the opponent, thus making `dp[i] = true`.
    - The answer for the original problem is `dp[n]`.

4. **Optimization and Winning Strategy**:
    - A player aims to leave the opponent in a position where all possible moves lead to configurations that are winning for the current player.
    - Understanding which configurations (number of stones) are inherently winning or losing (regardless of the moves that led there) is crucial. This is determined by the recursive computation and filling of the `dp` array.

5. **Conclusion**:
    - The algorithm finally checks if, with `n` stones, Alice has a winning strategy (`dp[n] == true`), which means she can force Bob into a losing position no matter how optimally he plays.

### Final Thoughts:

This problem beautifully illustrates the concept of "winning" and "losing" positions in combinatorial games and how optimal play can be computed using dynamic programming. The key is to systematically explore all possible moves and their consequences, building up a map of winning and losing states from which the overall strategy can be derived.
