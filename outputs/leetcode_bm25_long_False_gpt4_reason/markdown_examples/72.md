# Query `72`

## Original Question

*The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time some user performs a _change folder_ operation.

The operations are described below:

   `"../ "` : Move to the parent folder of the current folder. (If you are already in the main folder, remain in the same folder).
   `"./ "` : Remain in the same folder.
   `"x/ "` : Move to the child folder named `x` (This folder is guaranteed to always exist).

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is the operation performed by the user at the `ith` step.

The file system starts in the main folder, then the operations in `logs` are performed.

Return _the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder after the change folder operations._

Example 1:

Input: logs = \[ "d1/ ", "d2/ ", "../ ", "d21/ ", "./ "\]
Output: 2
Explanation: Use this change folder operation  "../ " 2 times and go back to the main folder.

Example 2:

Input: logs = \[ "d1/ ", "d2/ ", "./ ", "d3/ ", "../ ", "d31/ "\]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: logs = \[ "d1/ ", "../ ", "../ ", "../ "\]
Output: 0

Constraints:

   `1 <= logs.length <= 103`
   `2 <= logs[i].length <= 10`
   `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`.
   `logs[i]` follows the format described in the statement.
   Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to navigate back to the main folder after performing a series of folder change operations as defined in the logs. The operations can move the user into a child folder, keep them in the same folder, or move them up to the parent folder. The challenge is to compute the minimum steps back to the root without tracking the exact folder structure or names, only the depth relative to the root.

To address this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Counter for Depth:** We start by initializing a counter to keep track of the current depth relative to the main folder. Initially, this is set to 0, indicating we are at the root.

2. **Iterate Through Logs:** We then iterate through each operation in the logs. For each operation, we need to decide how it affects our depth:
   - If the operation is `"../ "`, it means move up to the parent folder. This should decrease our depth by 1, but only if we're not already at the main folder (depth > 0).
   - If the operation is `"./ "`, it means stay in the same folder, so our depth doesn't change.
   - If the operation is `"x/ "`, it represents moving into a child folder named `x`. This increases our depth by 1.

3. **Depth Limitation:** It's important to remember that the depth should never go below 0 because `"../ "` operations at the root folder do not change the depth. Similarly, we increment the depth for each `"x/ "` operation without any condition because it's guaranteed that the folder exists.

4. **Calculate Minimum Operations to Return:** Once all operations are processed, the depth counter will indicate how deep we are relative to the main folder. This depth is also the minimum number of operations needed to return to the main folder because each `"../ "` operation moves us one level up towards the root.

**Example Walkthrough:**

Let's take the second example provided: logs = \["d1/ ", "d2/ ", "./ ", "d3/ ", "../ ", "d31/ "\].

- Start at the main folder: depth = 0.
- "d1/ ": Move into a child folder, increasing depth to 1.
- "d2/ ": Move into another child folder, depth becomes 2.
- "./ ": Stay in the same folder, depth remains 2.
- "d3/ ": Move into another child folder, depth becomes 3.
- "../ ": Move up to the parent folder, decreasing depth to 2.
- "d31/ ": Move into another child folder, increasing depth to 3.

After performing all operations, we're 3 levels deep from the main folder. Thus, it would take a minimum of 3 `"../ "` operations to return to the main folder, making the answer 3.

**Implementation Note:**

This logic can be implemented in any programming language with a simple loop through the logs array, a counter for the depth, and conditional statements for each type of operation. It's a straightforward problem that tests understanding of basic string manipulation, conditionals, and loop constructs.

Flagged<br>            data points are points that either lie outside the image<br>            frame, are masked, or were rejected by sigma-clipping.

This is the main control for preventing<br>            ellipses to grow to regions of too low signal-to-noise<br>            ratio.  It specifies the maximum acceptable relative error<br>            in the local radial intensity gradient.  `Busko (1996; ASPC<br>            101, 139)<br>            <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ASPC..101..139B`_ showed<br>            that the fitting precision relates to that relative error.<br>            The usual behavior of the gradient relative error is to<br>            increase with semimajor axis, being larger in outer, fainter<br>            regions of a galaxy image.  In the current implementation,<br>            the ``maxgerr`` criterion is triggered only when two<br>            consecutive isophotes exceed the value specified by the<br>            parameter. This prevents premature stopping caused by<br>            contamination such as stars and HII regions.<br><br>            A number of actions may happen when the gradient error<br>            exceeds ``maxgerr`` (or becomes non-significant and is set<br>            to `None`).  If the maximum semimajor axis specified by<br>            ``maxsma`` is set to `None`, semimajor axis growth is<br>            stopped and the algorithm proceeds inwards to the galaxy<br>            center. If ``maxsma`` is set to some finite value, and this<br>            value is larger than the current semimajor axis length, the<br>            algorithm enters non-iterative mode and proceeds outwards<br>            until reaching ``maxsma``.  The default is 0.5.<br>        sclip : float, optional<br>            The sigma-clip sigma value.  The default is 3.0.<br>        nclip : int, optional<br>            The number of sigma-clip interations.  The default is 0,<br>            which means sigma-clipping is skipped.<br>        integrmode : {'bilinear', 'nearest_neighbor', 'mean', 'median'}, optional<br>            The area integration mode.  The default is 'bilinear'.<br>        linear : bool, optional<br>            The semimajor axis growing/shrinking mode. If `False`<br>            (default), the geometric growing mode is chosen, thus the<br>            semimajor axis length is increased by a factor of (1. +<br>            ``step``), and the process is repeated until either the<br>            semimajor axis value reaches the value of parameter<br>            ``maxsma``, or the last fitted ellipse has more than a given<br>            fraction of its sampled points flagged out (see ``fflag``).<br>            The process then resumes from the first fitted ellipse (at<br>            ``sma0``) inwards, in steps of (1./(1. + ``step``)), until<br>            the semimajor axis length reaches the value ``minsma``. In<br>            case of linear growing, the increment or decrement value is<br>            given directly by ``step`` in pixels.  If ``maxsma`` is set<br>            to `None`, the semimajor axis will grow until a low<br>            signal-to-noise criterion is met. See ``maxgerr``.<br>        maxrit : float or `None`, optional<br>            The maximum value of semimajor axis to perform an actual<br>            fit.  Whenever the current semimajor axis length is larger<br>            than ``maxrit``, the isophotes will be extracted using the<br>            current geometry, without being fitted.  This non-iterative<br>            mode may be useful for sampling regions of very low surface<br>            brightness, where the algorithm may become unstable and<br>            unable to recover reliable geometry information.<br>            Non-iterative mode can also be entered automatically<br>            whenever the ellipticity exceeds 1.0 or the ellipse center<br>            crosses the image boundaries.  If `None` (default), then no<br>            maximum value is used.<br><br>        Returns<br>        -------<br>        result : `~photutils.isophote.IsophoteList` instance<br>            A list-like object of `~photutils.isophote.Isophote`<br>            instances, sorted by increasing semimajor axis length.<br>        """<br><br>        # multiple fitted isophotes will be stored here<br>        isophote_list = []<br><br>        # get starting sma from appropriate source: keyword parameter,<br>        # internal EllipseGeometry instance, or fixed default value.<br>        if not sma0:<br>            if self._geometry:<br>                sma = self._geometry.sma<br>            else:<br>                sma = 10.<br>        else:<br>            sma = sma0<br><br>        # first, go from initial sma outwards until<br>        # hitting one of several stopping criteria.<br>        noiter = False<br>        first_isophote = True<br>        while True:<br>            # first isophote runs longer<br>            minit_a = 2  minit if first_isophote else minit<br>            first_isophote = False<br><br>            isophote = self.fit_isophote(sma, step, conver, minit_a, maxit,<br>                                         fflag, maxgerr, sclip, nclip,<br>                                         integrmode, linear, maxrit,<br>                                         noniterate=noiter,<br>                                         isophote_list=isophote_list)<br><br>            # check for failed fit.<br>            if (isophote.stop_code < 0 or isophote.stop_code == 1):<br>                # in case the fit failed right at the outset, return an<br>                # empty list.
