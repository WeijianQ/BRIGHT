# Query `85`

## Original Question

*A square triple `(a,b,c)` is a triple where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers and `a2 + b2 = c2`.

Given an integer `n`, return _the number of square triples such that_ `1 <= a, b, c <= n`.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).

Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), and (8,6,10).

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 250`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find all unique combinations of integers `(a, b, c)` within the range `[1, n]` that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. This problem is asking for the count of such "square triples" without actually needing to list them. 

### Steps to Solve:

#### 1. Understanding the Pythagorean Theorem:
The Pythagorean theorem applies to right-angled triangles, stating that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This is expressed as `c^2 = a^2 + b^2`. 

#### 2. Identifying Constraints:
Given the constraints `1 <= a, b, c <= n`, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` within this range to check if they satisfy the equation. However, since `c` is the hypotenuse, its smallest possible value is greater than `1`, and for practical purposes, `c` cannot be less than `a` or `b` when checking for Pythagorean triples.

#### 3. Optimizing Iteration:
To reduce the number of unnecessary checks, we can note that:
- For any triple `(a, b, c)`, `a` and `b` are interchangeable in terms of their role in the equation. This means we only need to consider cases where `a <= b` to avoid duplicates.
- `c` can be derived from `a` and `b`, so we do not need to iterate over `c`. Instead, for each pair of `(a, b)`, we can check if `sqrt(a^2 + b^2)` is an integer and within the range `[1, n]`.

#### 4. Implementing the Solution:
A brute-force approach would involve nested loops: one for `a` and another for `b`, where `a` goes from `1` to `n`, and for each `a`, `b` goes from `a` to `n`. For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)` and check:
- If `c` is an integer (i.e., the modulo of `c` with `1` is `0`).
- If `c` <= `n`.

If both conditions are satisfied, increment a counter.

#### 5. Optimization Potential:
For larger values of `n`, the brute-force approach may become inefficient. Potential optimizations could include:
- Pre-calculating squares of numbers from `1` to `n` to avoid repetitive calculation.
- Breaking the loop early when certain conditions are met (e.g., if `a^2 + b^2` exceeds `n^2`, further iterations for current `a` and `b` can be skipped).

#### 6. Example Calculation:
For `n = 5`, the calculation would check pairs `(a, b)`:
- `(3, 4)` gives `c = sqrt(9 + 16) = 5`, which is an integer and within the range, so it counts.
- Reversing `a` and `b` to `(4, 3)` also counts as a separate solution.
Thus, the output is `2` for `n = 5`.

### Conclusion:
To solve this problem, iterate through all possible pairs of `a` and `b`, calculate `c`, and check if it satisfies the conditions of being an integer and within the range `[1, n]`. Count and return the number of valid combinations. This problem helps in understanding the application of the Pythagorean theorem in programming and how to efficiently iterate through possible combinations within given constraints.

To avoid this one<br>    could just abandon the merge entirely, but a better solution is to attempt<br>    to reduce the merge such that it no longer covers any entries below it.<br><br>    To do this we first identify the bits that ARE ``X`` s in the merged<br>    key-mask but which are NOT ``X`` s in the entry that we're covering.

We then look to remove from the merge any<br>    entries which are either ``X`` s in this position OR have the same value as<br>    in this bit as the aliased entry.
