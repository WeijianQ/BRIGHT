# Query `125`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer `n`. You roll a fair 6-sided dice `n` times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:

1.  The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to `1`.
2.  There is at least a gap of `2` rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the `ith` roll is equal to the value of the `jth` roll, then `abs(i - j) > 2`.

Return _the total number of distinct sequences possible_. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 184
Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2, 3, 4), (6, 1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3, 1), etc.
Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
(1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).
(1, 2, 3, 6) is invalid since the greatest common divisor of 3 and 6 = 3.
There are a total of 184 distinct sequences possible, so we return 184.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 22
Explanation: Some of the possible sequences are (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2).
Some invalid sequences are (3, 6), (2, 4) since the greatest common divisor is not equal to 1.
There are a total of 22 distinct sequences possible, so we return 22.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 104`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and consider the constraints and how they impact the total number of distinct sequences possible.

### Understanding the Constraints

1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of Adjacent Values is 1:**
   - This constraint limits the pairs of numbers that can appear next to each other in the sequence. For a 6-sided dice, the possible values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We can quickly identify that:
     - Odd numbers (1, 3, 5) have a GCD of 1 with any other number except multiples of themselves (which are not present in the dice values).
     - Even numbers (2, 4, 6) have a GCD of 1 only with odd numbers because any pair of even numbers will have a GCD of at least 2.
   - Therefore, sequences must alternate between odd and even numbers or consist entirely of odd numbers.

2. **At Least a Gap of 2 Rolls Between Equal Valued Rolls:**
   - This constraint significantly reduces the number of valid sequences as a value cannot be repeated within a 3-roll span. For example, a sequence cannot have the same number in positions 1 and 3 but can have the same number in positions 1 and 4.

### Approach

Given these constraints, calculating the exact number of sequences directly is challenging due to the exponential growth of possibilities as `n` increases. However, we can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. We can create a state representation that considers the last two rolled numbers and the number of rolls made so far.

Let's denote `dp[i][j][k]` as the number of distinct sequences of length `i`, where `j` is the last number rolled, and `k` is the second last number rolled. We need to iterate through all possible values of `j` and `k` considering the constraints and update our dp array accordingly.

### Pseudocode

Here is a rough idea of what the dynamic programming solution might look like:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def countSequences(n):
    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    # Initialization: Starting with any number is valid
    for j in range(1, 7):
        dp[1][j][0] = 1  # There's no second last number, denoted by 0
    
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        for j in range(1, 7):
            for k in range(7):  # k can be 0, indicating no second last number
                for l in range(1, 7):
                    if isValidSequence(l, j, k):
                        dp[i][j][k] += dp[i-1][k][l]
                        dp[i][j][k] %= MOD
    
    # Sum all valid sequences of length n
    total_sequences = sum(dp[n][j][k] for j in range(1, 7) for k in range(7)) % MOD
    return total_sequences

def isValidSequence(last, second_last, third_last):
    # Check GCD constraint and gap constraint
    if gcd(last, second_last) != 1 or (third_last == last):
        return False
    return True

# You might need a gcd function implementation if not using a built-in one
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This pseudocode outlines a dynamic programming approach, but note that the actual implementation details, especially the `isValidSequence` logic, might need adjustments based on the exact rules for valid sequences (e.g., handling the initial state where there are fewer than 3 numbers in the sequence).

### Final Thoughts

This problem is a good example of how dynamic programming can be used to solve combinatorial problems with constraints. The key is accurately defining the state and transition to capture all possibilities while adhering to the given constraints.
