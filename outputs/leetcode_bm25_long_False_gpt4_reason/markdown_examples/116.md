# Query `116`

## Original Question

*Given a 2D integer array `circles` where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` represents the center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri` of the `ith` circle drawn on a grid, return _the number of lattice points_ _that are present inside at least one circle_.

Note:

   A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.
   Points that lie on the circumference of a circle are also considered to be inside it.

Example 1:

Input: circles = \[\[2,2,1\]\]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The figure above shows the given circle.
The lattice points present inside the circle are (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2) and are shown in green.
Other points such as (1, 1) and (1, 3), which are shown in red, are not considered inside the circle.
Hence, the number of lattice points present inside at least one circle is 5.

Example 2:

Input: circles = \[\[2,2,2\],\[3,4,1\]\]
Output: 16
Explanation:
The figure above shows the given circles.
There are exactly 16 lattice points which are present inside at least one circle. 
Some of them are (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 2), and (4, 4).

Constraints:

   `1 <= circles.length <= 200`
   `circles[i].length == 3`
   `1 <= xi, yi <= 100`
   `1 <= ri <= min(xi, yi)`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the number of unique lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie inside or on the circumference of at least one circle from a given set of circles. Each circle is defined by its center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri`.

To address this problem, we need to:

1. **Understand Circle Geometry in a Grid**: A point `(x, y)` lies inside or on a circle defined by center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri` if the distance between `(x, y)` and `(xi, yi)` is less than or equal to `ri`. The distance can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, which in a discrete grid translates to checking if `(x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2 <= ri^2`.

2. **Iterate Over Potential Lattice Points**: Since the circle is on a grid and we know the maximum possible values for `xi`, `yi`, and `ri`, we can iterate over a range of points that potentially fall inside any circle. The range of points to check could be determined by the minimum and maximum `xi` and `yi` values across all circles, expanded by the maximum `ri` to cover the entire area potentially containing lattice points inside the circles.

3. **Check Each Point for Inclusion in Any Circle**: For each point in our range, we check if it lies inside or on the circumference of any circle by applying the condition from step 1. If it does, we mark this point as included.

4. **Count Unique Points**: Since a point can lie inside multiple circles, it's essential to count each lattice point only once. This can be achieved by using a set data structure to store points that satisfy the condition for inclusion in at least one circle.

5. **Return the Count**: Finally, the number of unique points in our set represents the number of lattice points present inside at least one circle.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

- Initialize an empty set to keep track of unique points that lie inside or on the circumference of any circle.
- For each circle, calculate the bounding box that contains all lattice points for the circle. This is done by considering the circle's center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri`, leading to a bounding box from `(xi - ri, yi - ri)` to `(xi + ri, yi + ri)`.
- Iterate through each point `(x, y)` within this bounding box and apply the inclusion condition: if `(x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2 <= ri^2`, then add `(x, y)` to the set of included points.
- After checking all circles, the size of the set represents the total number of unique lattice points inside at least one circle.

This approach ensures that we only count each lattice point once, regardless of how many circles it lies inside, and efficiently calculates the total number of such points by leveraging the geometric properties of circles on a grid.
