# Query `62`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take `1`, `2`, or `3` stones from the first remaining stones in the row.

The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is `0` initially.

The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.

Return `"Alice "` _if Alice will win,_ `"Bob "` _if Bob will win, or_ `"Tie "` _if they will end the game with the same score_.

Example 1:

Input: values = \[1,2,3,7\]
Output:  "Bob "
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:

Input: values = \[1,2,3,-9\]
Output:  "Alice "
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:

Input: values = \[1,2,3,6\]
Output:  "Tie "
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

Constraints:

   `1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5  104`
   `-1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the outcome of a game where two players, Alice and Bob, take turns picking 1 to 3 stones from a row of stones with varying values, aiming to maximize their total score. The winner is the player with the highest score when all stones have been picked, or the game could end in a tie if both players have the same score. The challenge is to predict the winner given an array of stone values, assuming both players play optimally.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the concept of dynamic programming, which is particularly useful for making a sequence of interrelated decisions. Given that both players play optimally, we need to understand what "playing optimally" means in this context. It involves looking ahead and making decisions based on maximizing one's minimum gain or minimizing the possible loss, considering the opponent is also playing with the best strategy in mind.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process and relevant information that could help address the problem:

1. **Reverse Thinking**: It might be beneficial to think about the problem in reverse; that is, starting from the end of the array and moving backwards. This way, we can evaluate the best possible outcome for the player whose turn it is, given the remaining stones.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: We can use a DP array where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference (player's score - opponent's score) the current player can achieve starting from the ith stone. This encapsulates the concept of playing optimally by considering all possible moves (taking 1, 2, or 3 stones) and choosing the one that maximizes the player's score relative to the opponent's.

3. **Game Theory**: Since both players play optimally, we need to account for the fact that each player aims to maximize their score while minimizing their opponent's. This involves anticipating the opponent's best move and choosing the best counter-move.

4. **Base Cases and Recurrence Relation**: The base cases for the DP array could be the last few stones, where the choices are limited. The recurrence relation would involve calculating the best score difference for `dp[i]` based on the scores achievable from `dp[i+1]`, `dp[i+2]`, and `dp[i+3]`, considering the current player takes 1, 2, or 3 stones respectively.

5. **Initialization and Iteration**: We initialize the DP array based on the base cases and iterate backwards through the stone array, filling in the DP array using our recurrence relation.

6. **Evaluating the Winner**: Once the DP array is filled, the value of `dp[0]` will indicate the best possible score difference the first player (Alice) can achieve against Bob. If `dp[0]` is positive, Alice wins; if negative, Bob wins; if zero, it's a tie.

By considering these steps, we can devise an algorithm to determine the outcome of the game. It's crucial to handle edge cases, such as when the array of stone values is too short for multiple choices to be relevant, and to ensure that the algorithm efficiently traverses the array and calculates the DP values to handle arrays of up to `5 * 104` elements within reasonable time and space complexity.
