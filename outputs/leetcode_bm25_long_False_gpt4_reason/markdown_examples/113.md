# Query `113`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer `total` indicating the amount of money you have. You are also given two integers `cost1` and `cost2` indicating the price of a pen and pencil respectively. You can spend part or all of your money to buy multiple quantities (or none) of each kind of writing utensil.

Return _the number of distinct ways you can buy some number of pens and pencils._

Example 1:

Input: total = 20, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The price of a pen is 10 and the price of a pencil is 5.
- If you buy 0 pens, you can buy 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 pencils.
- If you buy 1 pen, you can buy 0, 1, or 2 pencils.
- If you buy 2 pens, you cannot buy any pencils.
The total number of ways to buy pens and pencils is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.

Example 2:

Input: total = 5, cost1 = 10, cost2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The price of both pens and pencils are 10, which cost more than total, so you cannot buy any writing utensils. Therefore, there is only 1 way: buy 0 pens and 0 pencils.

Constraints:

   `1 <= total, cost1, cost2 <= 106`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the total number of unique combinations of pens and pencils that can be purchased given a total amount of money and the individual costs of a pen and a pencil. The challenge involves accounting for all possible combinations, including the scenario where no items are purchased.

### Step 1: Understanding Constraints and Simple Cases

First, it's important to understand the constraints and the simplest cases:
- If either `cost1` or `cost2` is greater than `total`, it limits the possible combinations as you might not be able to buy even one of the more expensive items.
- If `total` is less than both `cost1` and `cost2`, the only possible way to spend the money is by buying none, which is a single combination.
- If `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2` are all equal, there are two distinct ways: buying one of the items and buying none.

### Step 2: Breaking Down the Problem

The problem can be approached by iterating through the possible quantities of one item (e.g., pens) and calculating the remaining amount of money that can be spent on the other item (e.g., pencils). For each quantity of pens, you determine how many pencils can be bought with the remaining money.

### Step 3: Calculating Combinations

1. **Iterate through the number of pens**: From 0 up to the maximum number of pens that can be bought with the total amount. The maximum number of pens is `total / cost1`.

2. **Calculate remaining money for pencils**: For each quantity of pens, calculate the remaining money as `remaining = total - (number_of_pens * cost1)`.

3. **Determine the number of pencils that can be bought**: With the remaining money, calculate the maximum number of pencils that can be purchased. This is `remaining / cost2`. Since we're including the option of buying none, add 1 to this number for each iteration.

4. **Summing up the combinations**: Add up the number of ways to buy pencils for each quantity of pens to get the total number of distinct ways to spend the money.

### Step 4: Edge Cases

- Ensure to handle cases where `total` is exactly divisible by `cost1` or `cost2`, including these in the count.
- Handle the case where both items are more expensive than the total by returning 1 (buying none).

### Conclusion

By systematically iterating through the possible quantities of one item and calculating the possibilities for the other with the remaining funds, you can determine the total number of distinct combinations for purchasing pens and pencils. This method accounts for all combinations, including the scenario where no items are bought, thus solving the problem efficiently within the given constraints.
