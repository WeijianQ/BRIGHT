# Query `117`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, hi]` indicates that `ith` rectangle has a length of `li` and a height of `hi`. You are also given a 2D integer array `points` where `points[j] = [xj, yj]` is a point with coordinates `(xj, yj)`.

The `ith` rectangle has its bottom-left corner point at the coordinates `(0, 0)` and its top-right corner point at `(li, hi)`.

Return _an integer array_ `count` _of length_ `points.length` _where_ `count[j]` _is the number of rectangles that contain the_ `jth` _point._

The `ith` rectangle contains the `jth` point if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= hi`. Note that points that lie on the edges of a rectangle are also considered to be contained by that rectangle.

Example 1:

Input: rectangles = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[2,5\]\], points = \[\[2,1\],\[1,4\]\]
Output: \[2,1\]
Explanation: 
The first rectangle contains no points.
The second rectangle contains only the point (2, 1).
The third rectangle contains the points (2, 1) and (1, 4).
The number of rectangles that contain the point (2, 1) is 2.
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 4) is 1.
Therefore, we return \[2, 1\].

Example 2:

Input: rectangles = \[\[1,1\],\[2,2\],\[3,3\]\], points = \[\[1,3\],\[1,1\]\]
Output: \[1,3\]
Explanation:
The first rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
The second rectangle contains only the point (1, 1).
The third rectangle contains the points (1, 3) and (1, 1).
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 3) is 1.
The number of rectangles that contain the point (1, 1) is 3.
Therefore, we return \[1, 3\].

Constraints:

   `1 <= rectangles.length, points.length <= 5  104`
   `rectangles[i].length == points[j].length == 2`
   `1 <= li, xj <= 109`
   `1 <= hi, yj <= 100`
   All the `rectangles` are unique.
   All the `points` are unique.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine for each point in the `points` array how many rectangles from the `rectangles` array contain that point. A rectangle is defined to contain a point if the point's coordinates satisfy the conditions `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= hi`, where `(li, hi)` are the dimensions of the rectangle and `(xj, yj)` are the coordinates of the point.

### Step by Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The first step is to clearly understand what it means for a rectangle to contain a point. Since all rectangles have their bottom-left corner at `(0, 0)`, a point `(xj, yj)` is contained within a rectangle `(li, hi)` if `xj` is less than or equal to `li` and `yj` is less than or equal to `hi`.

2. **Iterate Over Points**: For each point in the `points` array, we need to check how many rectangles contain that point. This implies iterating over each point and, for each point, iterating over each rectangle to check containment.

3. **Check Containment**: For a given point `(xj, yj)` and rectangle `(li, hi)`, we check if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= hi`. If both conditions are satisfied, the rectangle contains the point.

4. **Counting**: For each point, we maintain a count of how many rectangles contain it. This can be done by initializing a counter for each point before we start the containment checks, incrementing the counter each time we find a rectangle that contains the point.

5. **Returning the Results**: After we have processed all points against all rectangles, we will have a count for each point representing the number of rectangles that contain it. These counts are stored in an array corresponding to the order of points in the `points` array, which we return as the final result.

### Relevant Information:

- The coordinates of the points and the dimensions of the rectangles are given as integers.
- Points on the edges of a rectangle are considered to be contained by the rectangle.
- Both `rectangles` and `points` arrays can be quite large (up to `5 * 10^4` elements), indicating that efficiency could be a concern.
- The dimensions of rectangles and the coordinates of points can be very large (up to `10^9`), which does not affect the algorithm directly but might influence the choice of data types (e.g., using `long` in languages with 32-bit `int`).

### Pseudocode:

```plaintext
initialize an array `count` of length equal to the length of `points` with all values set to 0
for each point in `points`:
    for each rectangle in `rectangles`:
        if point is contained in rectangle:
            increment the corresponding `count` value for this point
return `count`
```

This approach is straightforward and ensures that we accurately count the number of rectangles containing each point. However, if performance becomes an issue due to the large size of input arrays, one might need to explore more efficient algorithms, possibly involving spatial indexing or sorting rectangles and points to reduce the number of necessary comparisons.
