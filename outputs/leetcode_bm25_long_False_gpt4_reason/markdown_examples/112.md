# Query `112`

## Original Question

*Alice is a caretaker of `n` gardens and she wants to plant flowers to maximize the total beauty of all her gardens.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `flowers` of size `n`, where `flowers[i]` is the number of flowers already planted in the `ith` garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer `newFlowers`, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers `target`, `full`, and `partial`.

A garden is considered complete if it has at least `target` flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

   The number of complete gardens multiplied by `full`.
   The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by `partial`. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be `0`.

Return _the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most_ `newFlowers` _flowers._

Example 1:

Input: flowers = \[1,3,1,1\], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1
Output: 14
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 2 flowers in the 0th garden
- 3 flowers in the 1st garden
- 1 flower in the 2nd garden
- 1 flower in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be \[3,6,2,2\]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.
There is 1 garden that is complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.
Thus, the total beauty is 1 \ 12 + 2 \ 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.

Example 2:

Input: flowers = \[2,4,5,3\], newFlowers = 10, target = 5, full = 2, partial = 6
Output: 30
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 3 flowers in the 0th garden
- 0 flowers in the 1st garden
- 0 flowers in the 2nd garden
- 2 flowers in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be \[5,4,5,5\]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.
There are 3 gardens that are complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.
Thus, the total beauty is 3 \ 2 + 4 \ 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 30.
Note that Alice could make all the gardens complete but in this case, she would obtain a lower total beauty.

Constraints:

   `1 <= flowers.length <= 105`
   `1 <= flowers[i], target <= 105`
   `1 <= newFlowers <= 1010`
   `1 <= full, partial <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is an optimization one, where Alice wants to distribute a given number of new flowers (`newFlowers`) across her `n` gardens (represented by the array `flowers`) to maximize the total beauty based on certain conditions. These conditions involve reaching a target number of flowers per garden for it to be considered complete, with rewards in terms of beauty points for complete gardens and for the minimum number of flowers in incomplete gardens. Let's break down the steps and considerations to solve this problem:

### Step 1: Understanding the Components

1. **`flowers` array**: Represents the starting number of flowers in each of Alice's gardens.
2. **`newFlowers`**: The total additional flowers Alice can distribute.
3. **`target`**: The number of flowers a garden needs to be considered complete.
4. **`full`**: The beauty points added for each complete garden.
5. **`partial`**: The beauty points added based on the minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens.

### Step 2: Strategy to Maximize Beauty

To maximize the total beauty, Alice needs a strategy that smartly allocates the `newFlowers` among her gardens. The key factors to consider include:

- **Prioritizing gardens**: Gardens closer to the `target` threshold should be prioritized to reach completion with fewer flowers.
- **Deciding on completeness**: It might not always be beneficial to aim for all gardens to be complete. Sometimes leaving some gardens incomplete but with a higher minimum flower count (when `partial` is high) could yield more beauty points.
- **Distribution of new flowers**: How to distribute the `newFlowers` among the gardens to balance between getting as many gardens to `target` as possible and increasing the minimum in incomplete gardens.

### Step 3: Calculating Maximum Beauty

1. **Sort gardens**: Sort the `flowers` array to easily identify which gardens are closer to completion.
2. **Allocate flowers to near-complete gardens**: Start by allocating flowers to gardens that are closest to the `target`, aiming to make as many complete as possible with the least number of flowers.
3. **Evaluate partial beauty**: Once a garden reaches completion, evaluate if continuing to add flowers to get other gardens to complete status is more beneficial than enhancing the minimum count in incomplete gardens.
4. **Dynamic allocation**: The decision to make a garden complete or improve the minimum in incomplete ones might change as flowers are allocated, especially considering the ratio of `full` to `partial` points.

### Step 4: Implementation Considerations

- **Binary Search for Optimal Distribution**: Considering the large possible range of `newFlowers` and garden counts, a binary search approach can be used to find the optimal distribution of flowers that maximizes beauty.
- **Greedy and Iterative Approaches**: Greedily making gardens complete until a point where the remaining `newFlowers` are better used to increase the minimum in incomplete gardens.

### Step 5: Edge Cases and Optimization

- **All gardens can be made complete**: Check if `newFlowers` is sufficient to make all gardens meet or exceed `target`, in which case, calculate the beauty directly.
- **High `partial` value strategy**: If `partial` is significantly higher than `full`, it might be more beneficial to focus on increasing the minimum flower count in incomplete gardens rather than making more gardens complete.

This problem requires a balance between making gardens complete and enhancing the beauty of incomplete gardens. An algorithmic solution would likely involve sorting, greedy allocation of flowers, and possibly binary search to find the optimal point where the addition of new flowers maximizes the total beauty according to the given rules.

If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.<br><br>Given a 0-indexed integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and two integers `capacityA` and `capacityB` representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return _the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants_.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation:<br>- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.<br>- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.<br>- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.<br>- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it. Bob does not have enough water for plant 2, so he refills his can then waters it.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 3, capacityB = 4<br>Output: 2<br>Explanation:<br>- Initially, Alice and Bob have 3 units and 4 units of water in their watering cans respectively.<br>- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.<br>- Alice and Bob now have 1 unit of water each, and need to water plants 1 and 2 respectively.<br>- Since neither of them have enough water for their current plants, they refill their cans and then water the plants.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill to water all the plants is 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.<br><br>Example 3:<br><br>Input: plants = \[5\], capacityA = 10, capacityB = 8<br>Output: 0<br>Explanation:<br>- There is only one plant.<br>- Alice's watering can has 10 units of water, whereas Bob's can has 8 units. Since Alice has more water in her can, she waters this plant.<br>So, the total number of times they have to refill is 0.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `n == plants.length`<br>   `1 <= n <= 105`<br>   `1 <= plants[i] <= 106`<br>   `max(plants[i]) <= capacityA, capacityB <= 109`"""<br><br>    MOD = 109 + 7<br><br>    def is_prime(n: int) - bool:<br>        if n <= 1:<br>            return False<br>        for i in range(2, int(n0.5) + 1):<br>            if n % i == 0:<br>                return False<br>        return True<br><br>    primes = [i for i in range(2, 91) if is_prime(i)]<br>    cnt = [0]  100<br>    for n in nums:<br>        cnt[n] += 1<br><br>    dp = [0]  (1 << 20)<br>    dp[0] = 1<br>    <br>    for i in range(30, 0, -1):<br>        if cnt[i] == 0:<br>            continue<br>        mask = [j for j in primes if i % j == 0]<br>        i = i // j<br>        if i  1:<br>            continue<br><br>        m = 0<br>        for j in mask:<br>            m |= 1 << (j - 2)<br><br>        for j in range(len(dp)-1, -1, -1):<br>            if dp[j] == 0:<br>                continue<br>            cur = 1<br>            for k in range(cnt[m]):<br>                cur = (cur  2) % MOD<br>                dp[j | m] = (dp[j | m] + dp[j]  cur) % MOD<br><br>    ans = sum(dp) % MOD<br>    ans = (ans - dp[0] + MOD) % MOD<br>    return (ans  (1 << (cnt[1] - 1))) % MOD
