# Query `55`

## Original Question

*There are `n` piles of `stones` arranged in a row. The `ith` pile has `stones[i]` stones.

A move consists of merging exactly `k` consecutive piles into one pile, and the cost of this move is equal to the total number of stones in these `k` piles.

Return _the minimum cost to merge all piles of stones into one pile_. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

Example 1:

Input: stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 2
Output: 20
Explanation: We start with \[3, 2, 4, 1\].
We merge \[3, 2\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 4, 1\].
We merge \[4, 1\] for a cost of 5, and we are left with \[5, 5\].
We merge \[5, 5\] for a cost of 10, and we are left with \[10\].
The total cost was 20, and this is the minimum possible.

Example 2:

Input: stones = \[3,2,4,1\], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: After any merge operation, there are 2 piles left, and we can't merge anymore.  So the task is impossible.

Example 3:

Input: stones = \[3,5,1,2,6\], k = 3
Output: 25
Explanation: We start with \[3, 5, 1, 2, 6\].
We merge \[5, 1, 2\] for a cost of 8, and we are left with \[3, 8, 6\].
We merge \[3, 8, 6\] for a cost of 17, and we are left with \[17\].
The total cost was 25, and this is the minimum possible.

Constraints:

   `n == stones.length`
   `1 <= n <= 30`
   `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`
   `2 <= k <= 30`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is a dynamic programming challenge, where we need to find the minimum cost to merge `n` piles of stones into one pile, given that we can only merge `k` consecutive piles at a time. The constraints suggest that a brute force approach may not be efficient enough, especially for larger values of `n`. Therefore, we must think of a more optimized solution that can handle the problem within these constraints.

### Key Observations:

1. **Mergeability Condition**: It's impossible to merge all piles into one if `(n - 1) % (k - 1) != 0`. This is because, after each merge operation of `k` piles, the total number of piles decreases by `k - 1`. Thus, to end up with a single pile, the initial `(n - 1)` must be divisible by `(k - 1)`.

2. **Subproblems**: The problem has an optimal substructure, meaning the solution to the problem can be composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems. This is a hallmark of dynamic programming.

3. **Overlap**: There are overlapping subproblems when trying to find the minimum cost to merge different segments of the array, which suggests that memoization could be useful.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:

To tackle this problem, we can use a 2D dynamic programming array, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to merge the piles from `i` to `j` into a single pile. The final answer will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, representing the minimum cost to merge all piles.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` with `0`, since the cost to merge a single pile is `0`.

2. **Prefix Sum**: Calculate a prefix sum array of the `stones` to efficiently calculate the sum of stones between any two piles `i` and `j`.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Fill the `dp` array by considering all possible segments of the `stones` array, from shorter segments to longer ones. For each segment `(i, j)`, try merging every possible `k` consecutive piles within this segment and choose the one with the minimum cost. The cost of merging piles from `i` to `j` includes the cost of merging the internal segments and the total sum of stones from `i` to `j` (since you ultimately merge these into one pile).

4. **Memoization**: Use memoization to store and reuse the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.

5. **Return**: After filling the `dp` array, check if merging is possible. If it is, return `dp[0][n-1]`. Otherwise, return `-1`.

### Implementation Sketch:

```python
def mergeStones(stones, k):
    n = len(stones)
    if (n - 1) % (k - 1) != 0:
        return -1
    
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i]
    
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for length in range(k, n + 1):  # Start from k because we cannot merge less than k piles
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][m] + dp[m + 1][j] for m in range(i, j, k - 1))
            if (j - i) % (k - 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] += prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]
    
    return dp[0][n - 1]
```

This approach efficiently solves the problem by breaking it down into manageable subproblems and building up the solution from these smaller parts, adhering to the dynamic programming paradigm.
