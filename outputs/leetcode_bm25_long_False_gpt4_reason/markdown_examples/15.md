# Query `15`

## Original Question

*Given an `m x n` integers `matrix`, return _the length of the longest increasing path in_ `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

Example 1:

Input: matrix = \[\[9,9,4\],\[6,6,8\],\[2,1,1\]\]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.

Example 2:

Input: matrix = \[\[3,4,5\],\[3,2,6\],\[2,2,1\]\]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is `[3, 4, 5, 6]`. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

Example 3:

Input: matrix = \[\[1\]\]
Output: 1

Constraints:

   `m == matrix.length`
   `n == matrix[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 200`
   `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the longest increasing path in a given 2D matrix, where from each cell, movement is possible only to adjacent cells in the horizontal or vertical direction (not diagonally), and the next cell in the path must have a greater value than the current cell.

To solve this problem, we can use depth-first search (DFS) along with memoization. The steps to address this problem are as follows:

1. **Initialization**: First, we need to create a memoization table, let's call it `dp`, with the same dimensions as the input matrix. This table will store the length of the longest increasing path starting from the cell (i, j). Initially, all the values in `dp` are set to 0, indicating that we haven't computed any paths yet.

2. **DFS Function**: We define a DFS function that takes the current position in the matrix (i, j) along with the matrix and the `dp` table. The purpose of this function is to explore all possible paths starting from (i, j) and return the length of the longest increasing path. The steps in the DFS function are:
   - If the value in `dp[i][j]` is not 0, it means we have already computed the longest path starting from this cell, so we can directly return `dp[i][j]`.
   - Otherwise, we explore all four possible directions from the current cell (up, down, left, right). For each direction, we check if the move is valid (i.e., within bounds and to a cell with a greater value). If it's a valid move, we recursively call our DFS function for the new cell and update our path length accordingly.
   - After exploring all directions, we update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum path length found + 1 (to account for the current cell) and return this value.

3. **Iterating Over the Matrix**: We iterate over each cell in the matrix, and for each cell, we call our DFS function if we haven't already computed the longest path from that cell (i.e., if `dp[i][j]` is 0). This step ensures that we explore paths starting from every cell.

4. **Finding the Maximum Path Length**: As we're computing the longest paths starting from different cells, we keep track of the maximum length found so far. This can be done by comparing the return value of each DFS call with the current maximum and updating the maximum accordingly.

5. **Return the Maximum Path Length**: After we've iterated over all cells and computed the longest increasing paths, the maximum value we've tracked will be the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix.

**Complexity Analysis**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. In the worst case, we might have to visit each cell once and compute the longest path starting from it. However, due to memoization, each cell's longest path is computed only once, ensuring that we don't redo any computation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the memoization table `dp`, plus the stack space used by the recursive calls, which in the worst case could be O(m * n) if the path includes all cells.

This approach efficiently finds the longest increasing path in the matrix by leveraging DFS to explore all possible paths and memoization to avoid redundant computations.
