# Query `111`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob are opponents in an archery competition. The competition has set the following rules:

1.  Alice first shoots `numArrows` arrows and then Bob shoots `numArrows` arrows.
2.  The points are then calculated as follows:
    1.  The target has integer scoring sections ranging from `0` to `11` inclusive.
    2.  For each section of the target with score `k` (in between `0` to `11`), say Alice and Bob have shot `ak` and `bk` arrows on that section respectively. If `ak >= bk`, then Alice takes `k` points. If `ak < bk`, then Bob takes `k` points.
    3.  However, if `ak == bk == 0`, then nobody takes `k` points.

   For example, if Alice and Bob both shot `2` arrows on the section with score `11`, then Alice takes `11` points. On the other hand, if Alice shot `0` arrows on the section with score `11` and Bob shot `2` arrows on that same section, then Bob takes `11` points.
    

You are given the integer `numArrows` and an integer array `aliceArrows` of size `12`, which represents the number of arrows Alice shot on each scoring section from `0` to `11`. Now, Bob wants to maximize the total number of points he can obtain.

Return _the array_ `bobArrows` _which represents the number of arrows Bob shot on each scoring section from_ `0` _to_ `11`. The sum of the values in `bobArrows` should equal `numArrows`.

If there are multiple ways for Bob to earn the maximum total points, return any one of them.

Example 1:

Input: numArrows = 9, aliceArrows = \[1,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0\]
Output: \[0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,2,3,1\]
Explanation: The table above shows how the competition is scored. 
Bob earns a total point of 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 47.
It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 47 points.

Example 2:

Input: numArrows = 3, aliceArrows = \[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\]
Output: \[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0\]
Explanation: The table above shows how the competition is scored.
Bob earns a total point of 8 + 9 + 10 = 27.
It can be shown that Bob cannot obtain a score higher than 27 points.

Constraints:

   `1 <= numArrows <= 105`
   `aliceArrows.length == bobArrows.length == 12`
   `0 <= aliceArrows[i], bobArrows[i] <= numArrows`
   `sum(aliceArrows[i]) == numArrows`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is a strategic allocation problem, where Bob needs to distribute his arrows across the scoring sections of the target to maximize his total score against Alice's already determined shots. This problem involves both strategy and optimization, considering the constraints and the scoring rules.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Scoring System**: The first step is to fully grasp how the scoring works. Each section of the target has a value from 0 to 11, and whoever shoots more arrows in a section wins that section's points. If both shoot an equal number of arrows (except zero), Alice wins the points. No points are awarded if neither shoots any arrows in a section.

2. **Strategizing for Bob**: Since Bob aims to maximize his points, he should focus on sections where he can outscore Alice with the least number of arrows possible. This means:
   - For sections where Alice has shot 0 arrows, Bob needs only 1 arrow to win those points.
   - For sections where Alice has shot arrows, Bob should evaluate if the points are worth the investment of arrows needed to outscore Alice.

3. **Allocation of Arrows**: Bob has a fixed number of arrows (`numArrows`). He must allocate these efficiently. The strategy includes:
   - Prioritizing higher-value sections where he can easily outscore Alice.
   - Deciding not to compete in sections where the cost (in arrows) to outscore Alice is too high compared to the potential points gained.

4. **Optimization Problem**: This is essentially an optimization problem with constraints:
   - Maximize points scored.
   - The sum of arrows allocated by Bob equals `numArrows`.
   - For each section, decide how many arrows Bob should shoot to optimize his score.

5. **Possible Approaches**:
   - **Greedy Strategy**: Start allocating arrows to win sections starting from the highest value, moving downwards, ensuring at each step that the allocation is optimal in terms of cost-benefit (points gained vs. arrows used).
   - **Dynamic Programming**: This could potentially be solved via dynamic programming by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (e.g., maximizing points with a subset of the total arrows across a subset of target sections) and building up to the overall solution.

6. **Implementation Consideration**: To implement a solution, one could:
   - Create a decision matrix or use a dynamic programming table to evaluate and keep track of the best allocations at each step.
   - Iterate through the target sections, considering the above strategies to decide the allocation for each section.
   - Ensure that the total arrows used do not exceed `numArrows` and adjust the strategy accordingly if they do.

### Conclusion

Given the problem's constraints and the need to maximize points, Bob should focus on winning sections where Alice's presence is minimal or where the investment in arrows yields a high return in points. The solution involves strategic thinking, understanding the scoring rules, and applying optimization techniques to distribute the arrows effectively. Depending on the exact values in `aliceArrows` and the total `numArrows` Bob has, the solution might lean towards winning many low-to-mid value sections or a few high-value sections. This decision-making process is at the heart of solving the problem and requires careful analysis and potentially algorithmic support to find the optimal or a sufficiently good allocation of Bob's arrows.
