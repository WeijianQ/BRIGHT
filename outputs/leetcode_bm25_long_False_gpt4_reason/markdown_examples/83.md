# Query `83`

## Original Question

*You are given `n`​​​​​​ tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `i​​​​​​th`​​​​ task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:

   If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU remains idle.
   If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the shortest processing time. If multiple tasks have the same shortest processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
   Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
   The CPU can finish a task then start a new one instantly.

Return _the order in which the CPU will process the tasks._

Example 1:

Input: tasks = \[\[1,2\],\[2,4\],\[3,2\],\[4,1\]\]
Output: \[0,2,3,1\]
Explanation: The events go as follows: 
- At time = 1, task 0 is available to process. Available tasks = {0}.
- Also at time = 1, the idle CPU starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 2, task 1 is available to process. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 3, task 2 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 2}.
- Also at time = 3, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 2 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 4, task 3 is available to process. Available tasks = {1, 3}.
- At time = 5, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 3 as it is the shortest. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 6, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 10, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

Example 2:

Input: tasks = \[\[7,10\],\[7,12\],\[7,5\],\[7,4\],\[7,2\]\]
Output: \[4,3,2,0,1\]
Explanation: The events go as follows:
- At time = 7, all the tasks become available. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Also at time = 7, the idle CPU starts processing task 4. Available tasks = {0,1,2,3}.
- At time = 9, the CPU finishes task 4 and starts processing task 3. Available tasks = {0,1,2}.
- At time = 13, the CPU finishes task 3 and starts processing task 2. Available tasks = {0,1}.
- At time = 18, the CPU finishes task 2 and starts processing task 0. Available tasks = {1}.
- At time = 28, the CPU finishes task 0 and starts processing task 1. Available tasks = {}.
- At time = 40, the CPU finishes task 1 and becomes idle.

Constraints:

   `tasks.length == n`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= enqueueTimei, processingTimei <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to simulate a CPU process scheduling mechanism with specific rules on task selection. To solve this, we need to carefully manage tasks based on their availability (based on `enqueueTime`) and their processing time. The goal is to return the order in which the tasks are processed by the CPU, adhering to the described rules:

1. **Idle CPU with available tasks:** Choose the task with the shortest processing time. If there are multiple, choose the one with the smallest index.
2. **Task processing:** The CPU processes tasks without interruption and can immediately start a new task upon finishing one.

Given these requirements, we can break down the solution into several steps:

### Step 1: Preprocessing and Initialization
- **Sort tasks by enqueue time:** This is not immediately necessary but understanding the order in which tasks become available is crucial. However, since we need to maintain the original indices for the final output, we should augment each task with its original index before any sorting.
- **Initialize data structures:** We need a data structure to keep track of available tasks that can be efficiently sorted by processing time (and secondarily by original index if processing times are equal). A min-heap/priority queue is suitable for this purpose. We also need a structure to store the final order of task processing.

### Step 2: Simulation
- **Iterate through time:** We simulate the passage of time. For each unit of time, we perform checks to see if tasks become available and if the CPU can start a new task.
- **Check for available tasks:** At each time step, we need to check if there are tasks that have become available (i.e., their `enqueueTime` is less than or equal to the current time). These tasks are added to our priority queue.
- **Process tasks:** If the CPU is idle and the priority queue is not empty, we select the next task to process based on the queue's ordering. The selected task is removed from the queue, and its index is recorded in our output structure. We then simulate the task's processing by advancing the time by its processing duration.

### Step 3: Handling Edge Cases
- **Tasks with the same enqueue time:** These tasks become available at the same time, and we must ensure they are all considered for selection in the correct order.
- **Idle CPU with no available tasks:** If the CPU is idle but no tasks are available, we should jump to the next `enqueueTime` of the remaining tasks to avoid unnecessary iterations.

### Step 4: Return the Result
- Once all tasks have been processed, the structure holding the order of processed tasks represents the solution to the problem.

### Relevant Information and Considerations
- **Efficiency:** Managing the tasks efficiently as time progresses is crucial, especially since the number of tasks `n` can be up to `10^5`. Efficient data structures like priority queues are essential.
- **Maintaining Original Indices:** We must keep track of tasks' original indices for the output, requiring augmentation of tasks with their indices before any sorting or reordering.
- **Jumping in Time:** To optimize the simulation, jumping forward in time to the next `enqueueTime` when the CPU is idle can save unnecessary iterations.

By following these steps and considerations, we can develop a solution that simulates the CPU's task processing and returns the tasks in the order they are processed, adhering to the given rules.
