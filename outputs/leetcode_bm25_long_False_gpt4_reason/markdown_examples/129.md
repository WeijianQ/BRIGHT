# Query `129`

## Original Question

*Alice and Bob are traveling to Rome for separate business meetings.

You are given 4 strings `arriveAlice`, `leaveAlice`, `arriveBob`, and `leaveBob`. Alice will be in the city from the dates `arriveAlice` to `leaveAlice` (inclusive), while Bob will be in the city from the dates `arriveBob` to `leaveBob` (inclusive). Each will be a 5-character string in the format `"MM-DD "`, corresponding to the month and day of the date.

Return _the total number of days that Alice and Bob are in Rome together._

You can assume that all dates occur in the same calendar year, which is not a leap year. Note that the number of days per month can be represented as: `[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]`.

Example 1:

Input: arriveAlice =  "08-15 ", leaveAlice =  "08-18 ", arriveBob =  "08-16 ", leaveBob =  "08-19 "
Output: 3
Explanation: Alice will be in Rome from August 15 to August 18. Bob will be in Rome from August 16 to August 19. They are both in Rome together on August 16th, 17th, and 18th, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: arriveAlice =  "10-01 ", leaveAlice =  "10-31 ", arriveBob =  "11-01 ", leaveBob =  "12-31 "
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no day when Alice and Bob are in Rome together, so we return 0.

Constraints:

   All dates are provided in the format `"MM-DD "`.
   Alice and Bob's arrival dates are earlier than or equal to their leaving dates.
   The given dates are valid dates of a non-leap year.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
To solve this problem, the essential task is to calculate the overlap in days between the periods Alice and Bob are in Rome. The steps to achieve this can be broken down as follows:

1. **Convert Dates to Comparable Formats**: First, we need to convert the given string representations of dates into a format that allows us to easily compare and calculate differences. A straightforward approach is to convert each date into the total number of days from the beginning of the year. This conversion requires knowledge of the number of days in each month.

2. **Identify the Overlap Period**: Once we have the dates converted into a numerical format that represents days from the start of the year, we can identify if there's an overlap in the periods Alice and Bob are in Rome. The overlap, if it exists, starts from the later of the two arrival dates and ends on the earlier of the two departure dates.

3. **Calculate the Duration of the Overlap**: If an overlap exists (i.e., the start of the overlap is before or on the same day as the end of the overlap), we calculate the number of days in this period. If there's no overlap, the result is 0.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1: Convert Dates to Days from Start of Year**

Given the month and day, we can calculate the total days from the start of the year by summing the days in the months before the given month and then adding the days in the current month. The array `[31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]` represents the days in each month for a non-leap year, which we use for this calculation.

**Step 2: Identify the Overlap Period**

- The start of the overlap is the maximum of Alice's arrival day and Bob's arrival day (later of the two arrivals).
- The end of the overlap is the minimum of Alice's departure day and Bob's departure day (earlier of the two departures).

**Step 3: Calculate the Duration of the Overlap**

- If the start of the overlap is later than the end of the overlap, there is no overlap, and the number of days they are in Rome together is 0.
- Otherwise, the duration of the overlap is `(end of overlap - start of overlap) + 1` (since both the start and end days are inclusive).

### Example Calculation

For the first example, with `arriveAlice = "08-15"`, `leaveAlice = "08-18"`, `arriveBob = "08-16"`, and `leaveBob = "08-19"`, we would:

- Convert the dates to days from the start of the year.
- Identify the overlap as from August 16 to August 18.
- Calculate the duration of the overlap as 3 days.

Thus, the function would return `3` for the first example. 

By following these steps for any given set of arrival and departure dates for Alice and Bob, we can calculate the total number of days they are in Rome together.

The plants are arranged in a row and are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right where the `ith` plant is located at `x = i`.<br><br>Each plant needs a specific amount of water. Alice and Bob have a watering can each, initially full. They water the plants in the following way:<br><br>   Alice waters the plants in order from left to right, starting from the `0th` plant. Bob waters the plants in order from right to left, starting from the `(n - 1)th` plant. They begin watering the plants simultaneously.<br>   It takes the same amount of time to water each plant regardless of how much water it needs.<br>   Alice/Bob must water the plant if they have enough in their can to fully water it. Otherwise, they first refill their can (instantaneously) then water the plant.<br>   In case both Alice and Bob reach the same plant, the one with more water currently in his/her watering can should water this plant. If they have the same amount of water, then Alice should water this plant.<br><br>Given a 0-indexed integer array `plants` of `n` integers, where `plants[i]` is the amount of water the `ith` plant needs, and two integers `capacityA` and `capacityB` representing the capacities of Alice's and Bob's watering cans respectively, return _the number of times they have to refill to water all the plants_.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: plants = \[2,2,3,3\], capacityA = 5, capacityB = 5<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation:<br>- Initially, Alice and Bob have 5 units of water each in their watering cans.<br>- Alice waters plant 0, Bob waters plant 3.<br>- Alice and Bob now have 3 units and 2 units of water respectively.<br>- Alice has enough water for plant 1, so she waters it.
