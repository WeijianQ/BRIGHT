# Query `53`

## Original Question

*You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:

   `1` representing the starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
   `2` representing the ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
   `0` representing empty squares we can walk over.
   `-1` representing obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return _the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once_.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,2,-1\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[1,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,0\],\[0,0,0,2\]\]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)

Example 3:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1\],\[2,0\]\]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 20`
   `1 <= m  n <= 20`
   `-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2`
   There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find all possible unique paths from a starting point (marked as 1) to an ending point (marked as 2) in a grid, traversing each non-obstacle cell (marked as 0) exactly once and avoiding obstacles (marked as -1). This problem involves backtracking and depth-first search (DFS) strategies to explore all possible paths under the given constraints.

To solve this problem, consider the following steps and relevant information:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Identify the starting point, the ending point, and count the number of non-obstacle squares. This count is crucial because to satisfy the condition of walking over every non-obstacle square exactly once, the length of the path must be equal to the number of non-obstacle squares + 1 (including the ending square).

2. **Backtracking Setup:**
   - Use a recursive function that attempts to move in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the current position.
   - Keep track of the current path length and compare it against the total number of non-obstacle squares to determine if the path covers all squares.

3. **Constraints and Checks:**
   - Before moving to a new square, check if it's within the grid boundaries, not an obstacle, and not already visited in the current path.
   - When the ending square is reached, check if the path length equals the number of non-obstacle squares + 1. If so, increment a path count.

4. **Backtracking Algorithm:**
   - From the starting point, explore all possible moves while adhering to the constraints.
   - Mark the current square as visited by temporarily setting it to an obstacle or a special value. This prevents revisiting the same square in the current path.
   - After exploring all directions from a square, backtrack by marking the square as unvisited, allowing it to be used in different paths.

5. **Counting Paths:**
   - Initialize a global or external variable to count the number of valid paths.
   - Each time the end is reached with the correct path length, increment this count.
   - After exploring all possible paths, return the count of valid paths.

6. **Optimizations:**
   - Pruning paths early that cannot possibly meet the criteria (for example, if you reach the ending square too early or isolate a section of non-obstacle squares) can significantly reduce the search space and improve efficiency.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle grids with no valid paths by ensuring the count remains 0 in such scenarios.
   - Consider the case where the starting and ending points are adjacent with no other non-obstacle squares, which is a valid path of length 1.

This approach, while straightforward in explanation, involves complex recursion and backtracking logic in implementation. It requires careful consideration of base cases, recursion exit conditions, and ensuring that the state is correctly maintained and restored at each step of the recursion.
