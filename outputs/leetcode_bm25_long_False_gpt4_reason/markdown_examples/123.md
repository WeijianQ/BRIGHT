# Query `123`

## Original Question

*You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`. Each cell has one of two values:

   `0` represents an empty cell,
   `1` represents an obstacle that may be removed.

You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell.

Return _the minimum number of obstacles to remove so you can move from the upper left corner_ `(0, 0)` _to the lower right corner_ `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[1,1,0\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can remove the obstacles at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to create a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2.
Note that there may be other ways to remove 2 obstacles to create a path.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,0,0,0\],\[0,1,0,1,0\],\[0,0,0,1,0\]\]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can move from (0, 0) to (2, 4) without removing any obstacles, so we return 0.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
   `2 <= m  n <= 105`
   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
   `grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the minimum number of obstacles (cells with value `1`) that need to be removed in order to create a path from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)` in a 2D grid, where movement is allowed up, down, left, or right from an empty cell (cells with value `0`).

To address this problem, we can use a graph traversal algorithm, treating the grid as a graph where each cell is a node and each movement possibility (up, down, left, right) represents an edge between two nodes. The weight of an edge can be considered as `0` if it leads to an empty cell, or `1` if it leads to an obstacle, indicating the cost (number of obstacles to remove) to move through that edge.

Here are the steps to approach this problem:

1. **Initialization**: Represent the grid as a graph. For this, you can simply use the grid itself, but you need to keep track of the cost (number of obstacles removed) to reach each cell.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Since we're interested in the minimum number of obstacles to remove, BFS is a suitable algorithm because it explores all possible paths breadth-wise, ensuring that once it reaches the destination, the path found is one of the shortest in terms of obstacles removed. Initialize a queue and start from `(0, 0)`, marking the starting cell with a cost of `0`.

3. **Tracking Costs**: As you explore the grid using BFS, maintain a 2D array of the same size as the grid to track the minimum number of obstacles removed to reach each cell. Initially, this can be filled with a large number (e.g., infinity) to indicate that cells are unreachable. When you visit a cell, update its cost if you've found a path with fewer obstacles removed than previously recorded.

4. **Exploring Neighbors**: For each cell you visit, look at its neighbors (up, down, left, right). If moving to a neighbor involves crossing an obstacle (i.e., the neighbor is a `1`), consider this path with an additional cost of `1`. If the neighbor is an empty cell (a `0`), the path cost does not increase. Only proceed to a neighbor if this results in a lower cost to reach that neighbor than any previously found path.

5. **Termination and Result**: The algorithm continues until either the destination cell is reached or all reachable cells have been explored. The minimum number of obstacles to remove is the cost associated with the destination cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle the edge case where the destination is immediately blocked by obstacles with no possible path, in which case, the algorithm should indicate that it's not possible to reach the destination by returning an appropriate value (e.g., `-1` or `infinity` if no path exists).

This approach leverages BFS for its efficiency in finding the shortest path in terms of steps (here, steps are analogous to obstacles removed) and is effective for grid-based pathfinding problems. The key is maintaining a cost matrix to keep track of the minimum obstacles removed to reach each cell, ensuring that the path to the destination is the one with the least number of obstacles removed.
