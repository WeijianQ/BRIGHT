# Query `14`

## Original Question

*There are `n` bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the `ith` round, you toggle every `i` bulb. For the `nth` round, you only toggle the last bulb.

Return _the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds_.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are \[off, off, off\].
After the first round, the three bulbs are \[on, on, on\].
After the second round, the three bulbs are \[on, off, on\].
After the third round, the three bulbs are \[on, off, off\]. 
So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.

Example 2:

Input: n = 0
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

   `0 <= n <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to figure out how many bulbs remain on after a series of toggling operations. The toggling follows a specific pattern based on the round number, and this pattern directly influences the final state of each bulb.

### Understanding the Problem

Initially, all bulbs are off. The process involves `n` rounds where:

- In the 1st round, every bulb is toggled (turned on in this case).
- In the 2nd round, every 2nd bulb is toggled.
- In the 3rd round, every 3rd bulb is toggled.
- This continues until the `nth` round, where only the `nth` bulb is toggled.

The challenge is to determine how many bulbs are on after these `n` rounds.

### Step by Step Reasoning

1. **Observing Patterns**: It's important to notice a pattern in the toggling. A bulb's final state (on or off) depends on the number of times it is toggled. Initially, all bulbs are off, so a bulb will end up on if it is toggled an odd number of times.

2. **Factors Determine Toggles**: Each bulb is toggled in rounds that are factors of its position number. For example, bulb 12 is toggled in rounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. This is because the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

3. **Square Numbers**: A crucial insight is that only square numbers have an odd number of factors. This is because factors usually come in pairs (e.g., 1 and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4 for 12), except when a number is a perfect square (e.g., 9, which has factors 1, 3, and 9). Thus, a bulb will be toggled an odd number of times (and therefore end up on) only if its position number is a perfect square.

4. **Counting Square Numbers**: To find out how many bulbs are on, we need to count how many perfect square numbers there are up to `n`. This is because, as established, only bulbs at these positions will be toggled an odd number of times and remain on.

5. **Mathematical Solution**: The number of perfect squares up to `n` is equivalent to the square root of `n`, rounded down to the nearest whole number (since the square root of `n` represents the largest possible square number within the range up to `n`).

### Conclusion

Given the above reasoning, the answer to the problem is the count of perfect square numbers up to `n`, which is mathematically determined by the integer part of the square root of `n`. This means for any input `n`, the output is `floor(sqrt(n))`.

**Examples Revisited**:

- For `n = 3`, the square numbers are 1. `sqrt(3)` is about 1.732, and taking the floor gives us 1. So, 1 bulb is on.
- For `n = 0`, there are no bulbs to toggle, so the answer is 0.
- For `n = 1`, there is 1 bulb, which is a perfect square, so it remains on. The answer is 1.

Therefore, to solve the problem programmatically or mathematically, one would simply calculate the square root of `n`, take its floor value, and that gives the number of bulbs that remain on after `n` rounds.
