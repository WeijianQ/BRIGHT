# Query `131`

## Original Question

*Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return _the number of common factors of_ `a` _and_ `b`.

An integer `x` is a common factor of `a` and `b` if `x` divides both `a` and `b`.

Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Example 2:

Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.

Constraints:

   `1 <= a, b <= 1000`*

The essential problem here is to find the number of common factors between two given positive integers `a` and `b`. To address this problem, let's break down the steps and the relevant information needed:

### 1. Understanding Factors
- A factor of a number is an integer that can divide that number without leaving a remainder.
- Both `a` and `b` have their own set of factors, including 1 and themselves.

### 2. Identifying Common Factors
- Common factors of `a` and `b` are those integers that are factors of both `a` and `b`.
- To find common factors, one way is to list all factors of `a` and `b`, then identify which ones are present in both lists.

### 3. Efficient Approach
Instead of listing all factors and comparing, a more efficient approach involves:
- **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`**: The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. It's significant because the GCD also contains all the common factors of `a` and `b`.
- **Counting the factors of the GCD**: Once we have the GCD, we only need to count its factors to know the number of common factors between `a` and `b`. This is because any factor of the GCD is by definition a factor of both `a` and `b`.

### 4. Calculating GCD
- The GCD can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

### 5. Counting Factors of GCD
- To count the factors of the GCD, we iterate from 1 to the GCD itself, checking if the GCD is divisible by these numbers without a remainder. Each time this is true, it indicates a factor.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Find the GCD of `a` and `b`** using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Initialize a count** variable to keep track of the number of factors.
3. **Iterate from 1 to the GCD** (inclusive), and for each number:
   - Check if it divides the GCD without leaving a remainder.
   - If it does, increment the count.
4. **Return the count** as the number of common factors.

### Example Walkthrough
#### Example 1:
- **Input:** a = 12, b = 6
- **GCD:** 6 (The largest number that divides both 12 and 6)
- **Factors of 6:** 1, 2, 3, 6
- **Output:** 4 (The count of factors)

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** a = 25, b = 30
- **GCD:** 5 (The largest number that divides both 25 and 30)
- **Factors of 5:** 1, 5
- **Output:** 2 (The count of factors)

This approach is efficient and avoids the need to directly list and compare all factors of `a` and `b`, especially as the numbers get larger within the constraint of `1 <= a, b <= 1000`.
