# Query `66`

## Original Question

*We have a wooden plank of the length `n` units. Some ants are walking on the plank, each ant moves with a speed of 1 unit per second. Some of the ants move to the left, the other move to the right.

When two ants moving in two different directions meet at some point, they change their directions and continue moving again. Assume changing directions does not take any additional time.

When an ant reaches one end of the plank at a time `t`, it falls out of the plank immediately.

Given an integer `n` and two integer arrays `left` and `right`, the positions of the ants moving to the left and the right, return _the moment when the last ant(s) fall out of the plank_.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, left = \[4,3\], right = \[0,1\]
Output: 4
Explanation: In the image above:
-The ant at index 0 is named A and going to the right.
-The ant at index 1 is named B and going to the right.
-The ant at index 3 is named C and going to the left.
-The ant at index 4 is named D and going to the left.
The last moment when an ant was on the plank is t = 4 seconds. After that, it falls immediately out of the plank. (i.e., We can say that at t = 4.0000000001, there are no ants on the plank).

Example 2:

Input: n = 7, left = \[\], right = \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\]
Output: 7
Explanation: All ants are going to the right, the ant at index 0 needs 7 seconds to fall.

Example 3:

Input: n = 7, left = \[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\], right = \[\]
Output: 7
Explanation: All ants are going to the left, the ant at index 7 needs 7 seconds to fall.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 104`
   `0 <= left.length <= n + 1`
   `0 <= left[i] <= n`
   `0 <= right.length <= n + 1`
   `0 <= right[i] <= n`
   `1 <= left.length + right.length <= n + 1`
   All values of `left` and `right` are unique, and each value can appear only in one of the two arrays.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine the moment when the last ant falls off a plank of length `n` units, given the starting positions of ants moving in opposite directions. The ants move at a constant speed of 1 unit per second, and when they collide, they simply swap directions without losing any time.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach the problem:

1. **Understand Ant Movement Dynamics**: The key insight is that when two ants collide and swap directions, it's equivalent to them passing through each other without changing direction. This is because all ants move at the same speed, and the collision doesn't alter their speeds. Thus, for the purpose of calculating when the last ant falls off, we can ignore the collisions.

2. **Identify Critical Information**: 
   - The length of the plank, `n`, sets the boundaries for the ants' movement.
   - The positions of ants moving to the left, given by the `left` array.
   - The positions of ants moving to the right, given by the `right` array.

3. **Calculate Time for Ants to Fall Off**:
   - For ants moving to the right, the time it takes for each ant to fall off is `n - position` of the ant. This is because the distance to the right end of the plank from any position is `n - position`.
   - For ants moving to the left, the time it takes for each ant to fall off is simply their position value, as it represents the distance to the left end of the plank.
   
4. **Determine the Last Moment**:
   - Find the maximum time it takes for any ant moving to the right to fall off. This is the maximum value of `n - position` for all positions in the `right` array.
   - Find the maximum time it takes for any ant moving to the left to fall off. This is the maximum value in the `left` array since it directly represents the time to fall off.
   - The last moment when an ant falls off the plank is the maximum of these two values. This is because we are looking for the moment when the last ant, regardless of direction, falls off.

**Putting it all together**:

- Calculate the maximum time for ants in the `right` array using `n - position`.
- Calculate the maximum time directly from the `left` array.
- The last moment when an ant falls off is the maximum of these two calculated times.

This approach simplifies the problem by recognizing that the direction change upon collision doesn't affect the timing of when ants fall off. It directly leads to calculating the necessary times based on initial positions and finding the maximum of these times to answer the question.

> def k_radius_average(nums, k):<br>    """There are `n` cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` from left to right and each car is present at a unique point.<br><br>You are given a 0-indexed string `directions` of length `n`. `directions[i]` can be either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'S'` denoting whether the `ith` car is moving towards the left, towards the right, or staying at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the same speed.<br><br>The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:<br><br>   When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by `2`.<br>   When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by `1`.<br><br>After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.<br><br>Return _the total number of collisions that will happen on the road_.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: directions =  "RLRSLL "<br>Output: 5<br>Explanation:<br>The collisions that will happen on the road are:<br>- Cars 0 and 1 will collide with each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, the number of collisions becomes 0 + 2 = 2.<br>- Cars 2 and 3 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 2 + 1 = 3.<br>- Cars 3 and 4 will collide with each other. Since car 3 is stationary, the number of collisions becomes 3 + 1 = 4.<br>- Cars 4 and 5 will collide with each other. After car 4 collides with car 3, it will stay at the point of collision and get hit by car 5. The number of collisions becomes 4 + 1 = 5.<br>Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 5. <br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: directions =  "LLRR "<br>Output: 0<br>Explanation:<br>No cars will collide with each other. Thus, the total number of collisions that will happen on the road is 0.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `1 <= directions.length <= 105`<br>   `directions[i]` is either `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'S'`."""<br><br>    n = len(nums)<br>    avgs = [-1]  n<br>    for i in range(k, n - k):<br>        sum = 0<br>        for j in range(i - k, i + k + 1):<br>            sum += nums[j]<br>        avgs[i] = sum // (2  k + 1)<br>    return avgs
