# Query `61`

## Original Question

*You are given an `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

   `1` which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
   `2` which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
   `3` which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
   `4` which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
   `5` which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
   `6` which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0, 0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. The path should only follow the streets.

Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

Return `true` _if there is a valid path in the grid or_ `false` _otherwise_.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[2,4,3\],\[6,5,2\]\]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[1,2,1\],\[1,2,1\]\]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)

Example 3:

Input: grid = \[\[1,1,2\]\]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine if there is a valid path from the upper-left cell (0, 0) to the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) in a grid, following the constraints dictated by the values in the grid cells that represent different types of streets. This involves not just moving through the grid but ensuring that each move is compatible with the type of street in both the current cell and the next cell.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and consider relevant information:

### 1. Understanding the Street Types

First, we need to fully understand what each value (1 through 6) represents in terms of connectivity:
- `1`: Connects left and right.
- `2`: Connects up and down.
- `3`: Connects left and down.
- `4`: Connects right and down.
- `5`: Connects left and up.
- `6`: Connects right and up.

### 2. Defining Movement Possibilities

Given the street types, we need to define possible movements from each type of street. For example, from a street of type `1`, you can only move left or right, assuming you're not at the grid boundary. This step is crucial for understanding how to traverse the grid based on the current position and the type of street you're on.

### 3. Traversing the Grid

Starting from (0, 0), the algorithm needs to explore the grid following the street connections. This exploration can be performed using either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The choice between DFS and BFS would depend on the specific requirements (e.g., finding the shortest path is not a requirement here, so either could be suitable).

- **Mark Visited Cells:** To avoid infinite loops, mark each visited cell. This can be done by keeping a separate boolean grid of the same dimensions or modifying the original grid if it's acceptable to change input data.
- **Check Connectivity:** Before moving to a neighboring cell, check if the current street type allows moving in that direction and if the destination cell's street type allows coming from the current direction.

### 4. Ending Condition

The traversal continues until either:
- The bottom-right cell is reached, in which case the function returns `true`.
- All possible paths are explored without reaching the bottom-right cell, returning `false`.

### 5. Implementation Highlights

- **Directional Mapping:** Create a mapping for each street type that defines which directions (up, down, left, right) are possible to move to from that type of street.
- **Recursion or Iteration:** Implement the traversal logic. A recursive DFS might be more straightforward to implement but watch out for stack overflow on very large grids. An iterative BFS or DFS with an explicit stack or queue might be necessary.
- **Boundary Checks:** Ensure that any move does not go outside the grid boundaries.

### 6. Example Walkthrough

Consider walking through one of the provided examples step-by-step using the chosen algorithm (DFS or BFS), applying the movement rules based on street types, and ensuring that the path follows valid connections until the end condition is met.

---

This problem essentially involves graph traversal where each cell is a node connected to potentially four other nodes (up, down, left, right), but the actual connections are limited by the street types. The solution requires carefully mapping these connections and efficiently traversing the grid while respecting the rules dictated by the street types in the grid cells.
