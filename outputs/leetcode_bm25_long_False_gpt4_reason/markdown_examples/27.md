# Query `27`

## Original Question

*You are given an array of `n` pairs `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [lefti, righti]` and `lefti < righti`.

A pair `p2 = [c, d]` follows a pair `p1 = [a, b]` if `b < c`. A chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion.

Return _the length longest chain which can be formed_.

You do not need to use up all the given intervals. You can select pairs in any order.

Example 1:

Input: pairs = \[\[1,2\],\[2,3\],\[3,4\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest chain is \[1,2\] -> \[3,4\].

Example 2:

Input: pairs = \[\[1,2\],\[7,8\],\[4,5\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest chain is \[1,2\] -> \[4,5\] -> \[7,8\].

Constraints:

   `n == pairs.length`
   `1 <= n <= 1000`
   `-1000 <= lefti < righti <= 1000`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the longest chain of pairs where each subsequent pair follows the previous one based on the condition that the second element of the previous pair is less than the first element of the following pair. This is a classic example of a problem that can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP) or Greedy algorithms.

### Step 1: Sort the Pairs
First and foremost, we need to sort the pairs to make it easier to find chains. A natural approach is to sort the pairs by their first element (ascending). However, to optimize the solution and make it easier to find the longest chain, it's more efficient to sort the pairs by their second element (ascending). This way, when we pick a pair to be part of the chain, we ensure that we have more room for the next pairs to follow.

### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy
#### Dynamic Programming Approach:
1. **Initialization**: Create a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain ending with the `i`-th pair. Initially, each pair can form a chain of length 1 by itself, so we initialize each element of `dp` to 1.
2. **Forming Chains**: For each pair `i`, look at all pairs `j` before it (where `j < i`), and if the `j`-th pair can be followed by the `i`-th pair (`pairs[j][1] < pairs[i][0]`), then we have the option to extend the chain ending at `j` by adding the `i`-th pair. We update `dp[i]` as the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
3. **Result**: The length of the longest chain will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

#### Greedy Approach:
1. **Sort the Pairs**: As mentioned, sort the pairs by their second element (ascending).
2. **Selecting Pairs**: Start with the first pair, and then iteratively select the next pair whose first element is greater than the second element of the current pair. Each time a pair is selected, increment your chain length by 1.
3. **Result**: The total number of selections is the length of the longest chain.

### Step 3: Complexity Analysis
- **Dynamic Programming**: The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops for comparing each pair with every other pair, and the space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the DP array.
- **Greedy Approach**: The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) primarily due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is \(O(1)\) if we ignore the space taken by the sorting algorithm or \(O(n)\) if considering the space for sorting depending on the algorithm used (e.g., Merge Sort).

### Conclusion
For this specific problem, the Greedy approach is more efficient due to its lower time complexity. By sorting the pairs by their second elements, we ensure that each time we select a pair for the chain, we do so in a way that leaves the maximum possibility for the remaining pairs to form a longer chain. This problem illustrates a common strategy in optimization problems: sorting elements to reduce the problem's complexity and then using a Greedy method to sequentially build the solution.

Thus it's been extended slightly from<br>    the simple diff-friendly algorithm given above.<br><br>    What @extend wants to know is whether two simple selectors are compatible,<br>    not just equal.  To that end, you must pass in a "merge" function to<br>    compare a pair of elements manually.  It should return `None` if they are<br>    incompatible, and a MERGED element if they are compatible -- in the case of<br>    selectors, this is whichever one is more specific.<br><br>    Because of this fuzzier notion of equality, the return value is a list of<br>    ``(a_index, b_index, value)`` tuples rather than items alone.<br>    """<br>    if mergefunc is None:<br>        # Stupid default, just in case<br>        def mergefunc(a, b):<br>            if a == b:<br>                return a<br>            return None<br><br>    # Precalculate equality, since it can be a tad expensive and every pair is<br>    # compared at least once<br>    eq = {}<br>    for ai, aval in enumerate(a):<br>        for bi, bval in enumerate(b):<br>            eq[ai, bi] = mergefunc(aval, bval)<br><br>    # Build the "length" matrix, which provides the length of the LCS for<br>    # arbitrary-length prefixes.  -1 exists only to support the base case<br>    prefix_lcs_length = {}<br>    for ai in range(-1, len(a)):<br>        for bi in range(-1, len(b)):<br>            if ai == -1 or bi == -1:<br>                l = 0<br>            elif eq[ai, bi]:<br>                l = prefix_lcs_length[ai - 1, bi - 1] + 1<br>            else:<br>                l = max(<br>                    prefix_lcs_length[ai, bi - 1],<br>                    prefix_lcs_length[ai - 1, bi])<br><br>            prefix_lcs_length[ai, bi] = l<br><br>    # The interesting part.
