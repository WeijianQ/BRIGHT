# Query `136`

## Original Question

*You are given a 0-indexed integer array `forts` of length `n` representing the positions of several forts. `forts[i]` can be `-1`, `0`, or `1` where:

   `-1` represents there is no fort at the `ith` position.
   `0` indicates there is an enemy fort at the `ith` position.
   `1` indicates the fort at the `ith` the position is under your command.

Now you have decided to move your army from one of your forts at position `i` to an empty position `j` such that:

   `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`
   The army travels over enemy forts only. Formally, for all `k` where `min(i,j) < k < max(i,j)`, `forts[k] == 0.`

While moving the army, all the enemy forts that come in the way are captured.

Return _the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured_. In case it is impossible to move your army, or you do not have any fort under your command, return `0`_._

Example 1:

Input: forts = \[1,0,0,-1,0,0,0,0,1\]
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Moving the army from position 0 to position 3 captures 2 enemy forts, at 1 and 2.
- Moving the army from position 8 to position 3 captures 4 enemy forts.
Since 4 is the maximum number of enemy forts that can be captured, we return 4.

Example 2:

Input: forts = \[0,0,1,-1\]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since no enemy fort can be captured, 0 is returned.

Constraints:

   `1 <= forts.length <= 1000`
   `-1 <= forts[i] <= 1`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the maximum number of consecutive enemy forts (`0`s) that can be captured when moving an army from one of your forts (`1`) to an empty position (`-1`), traversing only through enemy forts. This problem can be broken down into several steps to find an optimal solution:

### Step 1: Identify Your Forts and Empty Positions
First, we need to identify the positions of your forts (`1`) and empty positions (`-1`). These positions are potential starting and ending points for the movement of your army. 

### Step 2: Validate the Array
Check if there are any forts under your command. If there are no `1`s in the array, it's impossible to move your army, and you should return `0`.

### Step 3: Find Consecutive Enemy Forts
For each fort under your command, look for the closest empty position (`-1`) either to the left or right. During this search, count the number of consecutive enemy forts (`0`). This step is crucial because it determines the potential number of enemy forts that can be captured during a move.

### Step 4: Calculate Maximum Captures
Keep track of the maximum number of enemy forts captured in a single move. This involves comparing the number of enemy forts captured in each potential move and keeping the highest count. 

### Step 5: Consider Edge Cases
- If there are no empty positions (`-1`), you may not be able to make a move unless an empty position is not a strict requirement (the problem statement seems to imply it is necessary).
- Ensure that you are only considering moves that traverse through enemy forts. If there's a gap of `-1` between your fort and the next enemy fort, that path wouldn't count.

### Conclusion
After examining all potential moves from your forts to the closest empty positions, the maximum number of enemy forts captured during the best move is the answer. If no such move exists (either because there are no forts under your command or no valid path through enemy forts to an empty position), the answer is `0`.

### Pseudocode Example
This is a simplified approach to how one might start coding a solution based on the above steps:
```python
def max_captured_forts(forts):
    max_captured = 0
    for i in range(len(forts)):
        if forts[i] == 1:  # Your fort found
            # Check to the left
            left_count = 0
            for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
                if forts[j] == 0:
                    left_count += 1
                elif forts[j] == -1:
                    break
                else:
                    left_count = 0
                    break
            max_captured = max(max_captured, left_count)

            # Check to the right
            right_count = 0
            for j in range(i+1, len(forts)):
                if forts[j] == 0:
                    right_count += 1
                elif forts[j] == -1:
                    break
                else:
                    right_count = 0
                    break
            max_captured = max(max_captured, right_count)
    return max_captured
```
This pseudocode outlines a basic approach and does not handle all edge cases or optimizations but gives a foundational idea of tackling the problem.
