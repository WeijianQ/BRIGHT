# Query `89`

## Original Question

*You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the `ith` obstacle.

For every index `i` between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course in `obstacles` such that:

   You choose any number of obstacles between `0` and `i` inclusive.
   You must include the `ith` obstacle in the course.
   You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in `obstacles`.
   Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately before it.

Return _an array_ `ans` _of length_ `n`, _where_ `ans[i]` _is the length of the longest obstacle course for index_ `i` _as described above_.

Example 1:

Input: obstacles = \[1,2,3,2\]
Output: \[1,2,3,3\]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: \[1\], \[1\] has length 1.
- i = 1: \[1,2\], \[1,2\] has length 2.
- i = 2: \[1,2,3\], \[1,2,3\] has length 3.
- i = 3: \[1,2,3,2\], \[1,2,2\] has length 3.

Example 2:

Input: obstacles = \[2,2,1\]
Output: \[1,2,1\]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: \[2\], \[2\] has length 1.
- i = 1: \[2,2\], \[2,2\] has length 2.
- i = 2: \[2,2,1\], \[1\] has length 1.

Example 3:

Input: obstacles = \[3,1,5,6,4,2\]
Output: \[1,1,2,3,2,2\]
Explanation: The longest valid obstacle course at each position is:
- i = 0: \[3\], \[3\] has length 1.
- i = 1: \[3,1\], \[1\] has length 1.
- i = 2: \[3,1,5\], \[3,5\] has length 2. \[1,5\] is also valid.
- i = 3: \[3,1,5,6\], \[3,5,6\] has length 3. \[1,5,6\] is also valid.
- i = 4: \[3,1,5,6,4\], \[3,4\] has length 2. \[1,4\] is also valid.
- i = 5: \[3,1,5,6,4,2\], \[1,2\] has length 2.

Constraints:

   `n == obstacles.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= obstacles[i] <= 107`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find, for each obstacle, the length of the longest subsequence up to that point (inclusive) that forms a non-decreasing sequence when considering the heights of the obstacles. This involves a dynamic programming approach or a binary search method for efficiency due to the constraints on the size of the input.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialization**: We need an array, let's call it `dp`, of the same length as `obstacles`, to store the length of the longest valid obstacle course ending at each index. Initially, all values in `dp` are set to 1, since the minimum length considering any obstacle by itself is 1.

2. **Iterate through obstacles**: We will iterate through each obstacle and for each one, we need to find the longest obstacle course that ends with the current obstacle. This requires checking previous obstacles.

3. **Finding the longest valid preceding subsequence**: For each obstacle `i`, we look back at obstacles `[0, i-1]` to find those that are of the same height or shorter. The length of the longest obstacle course for `i` would be 1 plus the maximum length found among these valid preceding obstacles.

4. **Optimization**: Directly iterating back for each obstacle results in a quadratic time complexity, which is not efficient for large inputs. To optimize, we can use a data structure like a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Segment Tree to efficiently find the maximum length of a valid obstacle course that an obstacle can append to. Alternatively, a sorted list or a binary search on a dynamic list can be used to keep track of the lengths of the longest sequences found so far, and where new obstacles can fit into these sequences.

5. **Update and Store Results**: After finding the length of the longest valid obstacle course for the current obstacle, update the `dp` array with this length. 

6. **Return the Result**: After processing all obstacles, the `dp` array will contain the required lengths for the longest obstacle courses at each index, which we return as the final result.

### Relevant Information:

- The `dp` array is crucial for dynamic programming, storing intermediate results to avoid recalculating.
- Using a binary search approach within a dynamic list (which could be maintained to represent the ends of the longest obstacle courses found so far in a sorted manner) allows for efficiently finding the longest subsequence an obstacle can append to. This list or structure essentially maps the height of obstacles to the maximum length of a valid sequence ending with an obstacle of that height.
- The binary search is applicable because we're looking for a non-decreasing subsequence, and as we move through the obstacles array, we're essentially looking for the "right place" to insert the current obstacle's height in a sorted sequence of previous results to either extend an existing sequence or start a new one.
- This problem tests understanding of dynamic programming and binary search in the context of sequence and subsequence problems, highlighting the importance of optimizing brute-force approaches for larger datasets.

By following these steps, one can solve the problem efficiently, ensuring that the solution scales well with the input size, adhering to the constraints given in the problem statement.
