# Query `64`

## Original Question

*Given a rectangular pizza represented as a `rows x cols` matrix containing the following characters: `'A'` (an apple) and `'.'` (empty cell) and given the integer `k`. You have to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts.

For each cut you choose the direction: vertical or horizontal, then you choose a cut position at the cell boundary and cut the pizza into two pieces. If you cut the pizza vertically, give the left part of the pizza to a person. If you cut the pizza horizontally, give the upper part of the pizza to a person. Give the last piece of pizza to the last person.

_Return the number of ways of cutting the pizza such that each piece contains at least one apple._ Since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo 10^9 + 7.

Example 1:

Input: pizza = \[ "A.. ", "AAA ", "... "\], k = 3
Output: 3 
Explanation: The figure above shows the three ways to cut the pizza. Note that pieces must contain at least one apple.

Example 2:

Input: pizza = \[ "A.. ", "AA. ", "... "\], k = 3
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: pizza = \[ "A.. ", "A.. ", "... "\], k = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

   `1 <= rows, cols <= 50`
   `rows == pizza.length`
   `cols == pizza[i].length`
   `1 <= k <= 10`
   `pizza` consists of characters `'A'` and `'.'` only.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the number of ways to cut a given rectangular pizza into `k` pieces, ensuring each piece contains at least one apple (`'A'`). This involves making `k-1` cuts, either horizontally or vertically, and distributing the resulting pieces. To tackle this, we must account for the placement of apples to ensure every cut results in pieces that all contain at least one apple. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Pizza Layout

First, we need to understand the distribution of apples on the pizza. This involves creating a matrix that represents the pizza, where each cell can either contain an apple (`'A'`) or be empty (`'.'`). From this matrix, we can derive auxiliary information such as the number of apples in any given row or column, which is crucial for deciding where cuts can be made.

### Step 2: Defining the Subproblems

The problem naturally lends itself to a dynamic programming approach. We can define a subproblem as finding the number of ways to cut a sub-rectangle of the pizza into `m` pieces, where `m <= k`, such that each piece has at least one apple. The base case is when `m = 1`, where the answer is 1 if the sub-rectangle contains at least one apple, and 0 otherwise.

### Step 3: Computing the Number of Ways

For each sub-rectangle and each possible `m`, we consider every possible cut. If we make a horizontal cut, we divide the pizza into an upper and a lower part. For a vertical cut, we divide it into a left and a right part. For each cut, we recursively compute the number of ways to cut the resulting pieces into smaller parts, ensuring each part contains at least one apple.

### Step 4: Memoization

Since there will be overlapping subproblems (i.e., we might compute the number of ways to cut a particular sub-rectangle into `m` pieces multiple times), we use memoization to store the results of subproblems we have already solved. This prevents redundant computations and significantly speeds up the process.

### Step 5: Modulo Operation

Given that the number of ways can be huge, we are asked to return the result modulo 10^9 + 7. This means at every step of adding or multiplying ways, we take the result modulo 10^9 + 7 to keep the numbers manageable and within the bounds of typical integer types in programming languages.

### Algorithm Summary

1. **Preprocessing**: Compute the cumulative sum of apples in rows and columns to quickly check if a sub-rectangle contains at least one apple.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a 3D DP array where `dp[x][y][m]` represents the number of ways to cut the sub-rectangle defined by the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (x,y) into `m` pieces. Initialize `dp[x][y][1]` based on whether there's at least one apple in the sub-rectangle.
3. **Recursion with Memoization**: For each `dp[x][y][m]`, iterate through all possible cuts and sum up the ways, using memoization to avoid recomputing.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 at each step of addition or multiplication to ensure the result stays within bounds.

### Conclusion

This problem, with its constraints and requirements, is an excellent candidate for a dynamic programming approach with memoization, leveraging auxiliary data like cumulative sums to make efficient decisions about where to make cuts. By breaking down the problem into manageable subproblems, utilizing memoization to avoid redundant computations, and carefully handling the modulo operation, we can compute the number of ways to cut the pizza as required.
