# Query `5`

## Original Question

*There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

   For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\]\]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = \[\[1,0\],\[0,1\]\]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

Constraints:

   `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
   `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
   `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
   `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
   All the pairs prerequisites\[i\] are unique.*

The essential problem here is to determine if it's possible to complete all courses given the prerequisites for each course. This is a classic problem of detecting a cycle in a directed graph, where each course can be represented as a node, and a directed edge from node `bi` to node `ai` represents that course `ai` has a prerequisite `bi`. If there's a cycle in this graph, it means there are circular dependencies among courses, making it impossible to complete all courses. Conversely, if the graph has no cycles, it means it's possible to take all courses in a sequence that respects all the prerequisites.

To address this problem, we can use several strategies, but a common and efficient approach is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. **Graph Representation**: First, represent the courses and prerequisites as a graph. This can be done using an adjacency list, where each key is a course, and the value is a list of courses that are prerequisites for the key course.

2. **Detecting Cycles**: Use DFS to traverse the graph and detect if there's a cycle. For each node (course), mark it as being visited while exploring all its neighbors (prerequisites). If during this exploration you encounter a node that is already being visited, it means there's a cycle. After exploring all neighbors of a node, mark it as explored.

3. **Handling Multiple Components**: Since the graph might consist of several disconnected components, ensure to start a DFS from every node that hasn't been explored yet.

4. **Return Value**: If a cycle is detected at any point, return `false`. If the DFS completes without finding any cycles, return `true`.

To implement the DFS, you can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach with a stack. Additionally, you'll need a way to track the state of each node: not visited, being visited (part of the current DFS path), and fully visited (all neighbors explored).

Here's a high-level algorithm:

- Initialize an adjacency list for the graph.
- Populate the adjacency list with the prerequisites.
- Initialize three sets or arrays to keep track of visited nodes: one for nodes not yet visited, one for nodes currently being visited, and one for nodes fully visited.
- For each course, if it's not yet visited, start a DFS from that course.
    - In the DFS, mark the course as being visited.
    - Explore all adjacent courses (prerequisites). If any of these courses are currently being visited, a cycle is detected, and return `false`. If they are not visited, recursively apply DFS on them.
    - After exploring all adjacent courses, mark the current course as fully visited.
- If no cycles are detected in any component of the graph, return `true`.

This approach efficiently solves the problem by focusing on the core issue of cycle detection in a directed graph, which directly correlates to the feasibility of completing all courses given their prerequisites.
