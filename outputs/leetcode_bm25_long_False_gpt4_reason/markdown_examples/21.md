# Query `21`

## Original Question

*You are given `row x col` `grid` representing a map where `grid[i][j] = 1` represents land and `grid[i][j] = 0` represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The `grid` is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes ", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,0,0\],\[1,1,1,0\],\[0,1,0,0\],\[1,1,0,0\]\]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[1\]\]
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: grid = \[\[1,0\]\]
Output: 4

Constraints:

   `row == grid.length`
   `col == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= row, col <= 100`
   `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
   There is exactly one island in `grid`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to calculate the perimeter of a single island on a grid, where the island is represented by connected cells with the value `1` (land), surrounded by cells with the value `0` (water). The cells are only connected horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. The grid itself is surrounded by water, ensuring that the island is finite and isolated. 

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Iterate through the grid**: We need to go through each cell in the grid to check whether it is part of the island (a `1`). 

2. **Identify land cells**: When we find a cell that is part of the island, we need to determine its contribution to the overall perimeter. The key insight is that a cell contributes to the perimeter based on the number of its sides that are adjacent to water (or the edge of the grid, which is also surrounded by water). 

3. **Calculate the contribution of each land cell to the perimeter**: 
    - If a land cell is on the edge of the grid, some of its sides will automatically contribute to the perimeter.
    - For land cells not on the edge, we need to check their four neighbors (up, down, left, right). If any neighbor is water (or out of bounds, which is equivalent to water), that side contributes to the perimeter.

4. **Sum up contributions**: By adding up the contributions from all the land cells, we get the total perimeter of the island.

**Relevant information**:
- Each land cell has up to 4 sides that can contribute to the perimeter.
- The perimeter contribution of a land cell is the number of its sides that are adjacent to water.
- Cells on the grid edge have at least one side that automatically counts towards the perimeter if they are land cells.

**Example walkthrough**:
- Consider the first example grid `[[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]`.
- Starting from the top left corner, we move through the grid. When we hit the second cell (which is land), we see it has 3 sides adjacent to water (1 contribution from each of the left, top, and right sides), so its perimeter contribution is 3.
- We continue this process for each land cell, checking its neighbors and counting the sides adjacent to water.
- Summing these contributions gives us the total perimeter, which, for this example, is 16.

This method efficiently calculates the island's perimeter by considering each land cell's immediate surroundings, ensuring that all edge cases, such as cells on the grid's boundary or cells surrounded by land on multiple sides, are correctly handled.
