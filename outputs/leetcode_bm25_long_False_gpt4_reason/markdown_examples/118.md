# Query `118`

## Original Question

*You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `flowers`, where `flowers[i] = [starti, endi]` means the `ith` flower will be in full bloom from `starti` to `endi` (inclusive). You are also given a 0-indexed integer array `people` of size `n`, where `poeple[i]` is the time that the `ith` person will arrive to see the flowers.

Return _an integer array_ `answer` _of size_ `n`_, where_ `answer[i]` _is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the_ `ith` _person arrives._

Example 1:

Input: flowers = \[\[1,6\],\[3,7\],\[9,12\],\[4,13\]\], poeple = \[2,3,7,11\]
Output: \[1,2,2,2\]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.

Example 2:

Input: flowers = \[\[1,10\],\[3,3\]\], poeple = \[3,3,2\]
Output: \[2,2,1\]
Explanation: The figure above shows the times when the flowers are in full bloom and when the people arrive.
For each person, we return the number of flowers in full bloom during their arrival.

Constraints:

   `1 <= flowers.length <= 5  104`
   `flowers[i].length == 2`
   `1 <= starti <= endi <= 109`
   `1 <= people.length <= 5  104`
   `1 <= people[i] <= 109`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to efficiently calculate the number of flowers in full bloom for each person's arrival time, given the bloom duration of each flower and the arrival times of the people.

To solve this problem, let's consider the steps and relevant information needed:

### 1. Understanding the Data Structure

- The `flowers` array contains pairs `[starti, endi]` representing the bloom start and end times for each flower.
- The `people` array contains the times at which each person arrives to see the flowers.

### 2. Identifying the Output

- We need to return an array where each element `i` corresponds to the number of flowers in full bloom at the time `people[i]` arrives.

### 3. Approach to Solution

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a brute-force approach (checking each person against every flower) would be inefficient, especially with the possibility of up to 50,000 flowers and people. Here are steps to a more efficient solution:

#### Step 1: Preprocessing

- **Event Marking**: Consider each bloom period start and end as an event. Create a list of events where a positive value marks the start of a bloom and a negative value marks the end. This way, we can traverse through time, adding flowers as they bloom and removing them as they fade.

#### Step 2: Sorting

- **Sort Events**: Sort the events by time. If two events happen at the same time, ensure that bloom starts (positive values) are processed before ends (negative values) to correctly count flowers blooming and fading at the same time.
- **Sort People**: Also, sort the `people` array to traverse through the events and people in a single pass later on.

#### Step 3: Counting Blooms

- Traverse through the sorted events and maintain a running count of blooming flowers. For each event:
  - If it's a bloom start, increment the count.
  - If it's a bloom end, decrement the count.
- As you traverse, for each person (in sorted order), record the current count of blooming flowers at their arrival time.

#### Step 4: Mapping Counts to Original Order

- Since the people were sorted for efficient counting, we need to map the bloom counts back to the original order of people's arrivals.

#### Step 5: Constructing the Answer

- Create the answer array based on the mapped counts corresponding to each person's original arrival time.

### 4. Complexity Consideration

- Sorting events and people takes O(n log n) time, where n is the total number of events or people.
- A single pass to count blooms and map to people is O(n), making the overall approach efficient.

### 5. Potential Optimizations

- **Space Optimization**: Instead of marking start and end separately, consider using a more compact representation if space becomes an issue.
- **Parallel Processing**: For very large inputs, consider dividing the timeline into segments that can be processed in parallel, merging results at the end.

### Conclusion

This approach provides a scalable way to determine the number of flowers in bloom for each person's arrival by efficiently processing events in chronological order and mapping the bloom counts to the original order of arrivals.
