# Query `28`

## Original Question

*In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:

   Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
   Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string `senate` representing each senator's party belonging. The character `'R'` and `'D'` represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be `"Radiant "` or `"Dire "`.

Example 1:

Input: senate =  "RD "
Output:  "Radiant "
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:

Input: senate =  "RDD "
Output:  "Dire "
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Constraints:

   `n == senate.length`
   `1 <= n <= 104`
   `senate[i]` is either `'R'` or `'D'`.*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem in this scenario is to determine which party (Radiant or Dire) will ultimately be able to exercise control and make a decision on the change in the Dota2 game by strategically banning the other party's senators from voting, leading to a situation where all remaining senators are from one party, allowing them to announce victory.

### Understanding the Problem

The problem can be broken down into several key components:

1. **Round-based Voting:** The procedure is iterative, with each round allowing each senator (who has not been banned) to either ban another senator or declare victory if all remaining senators are from their party.
2. **Strategic Banning:** Senators must choose whom to ban in a way that maximizes their party's chance of ending up as the only party able to vote.
3. **Victory Conditions:** A party wins if, after any round, all senators able to vote belong to that party.

### Relevant Information

To solve this problem, consider the following information:

- **Order of Voting:** The sequence in which senators vote matters because it affects who gets to ban whom first.
- **Balancing of Power:** Initially, the balance between the two parties (how many senators each has) will influence the strategy.
- **Strategic Decisions:** Senators need to decide whom to ban not just based on the current round but also considering future rounds.

### Step by Step Reasoning

1. **Initialize Counts:** Keep track of the number of senators from each party that are currently able to vote.
2. **Track Bans:** Also, keep track of how many senators from each party are queued to be banned in the next round. This is because if a senator bans another senator, the effect is not immediate but rather takes effect in the following round.
3. **Iterate Through Rounds:**
   - In each round, iterate through all senators in the order given.
   - For each senator, decide whether to ban an opponent senator or, if possible, announce victory.
   - Adjust the counts and queue bans accordingly.
4. **Banning Strategy:**
   - A senator should always choose to ban an opponent senator if possible, to reduce the voting power of the opposing party in future rounds.
   - The choice of whom to ban within the opposing party can be simplified to just reducing the count of the opposing party, as specific identities don't matter in this abstract representation.
5. **Announcing Victory:**
   - If at any point all remaining senators are from one party, that party can announce victory.
   - This check should be done after each senator's turn to ensure timely detection of the victory condition.

### Solution Approach

Given the problem's iterative nature and the strategic decision-making involved, a simulation approach can effectively determine the outcome. By simulating each round according to the rules and strategies described, we can predict which party will ultimately be able to announce victory. The simulation continues until one party has all its senators banned, allowing the other party to declare victory.

This approach requires careful management of counts and understanding of the dynamics between banning and the rounds, as well as implementing logic to efficiently determine when one party has won.

### Conclusion

This problem models a strategic, iterative decision-making process within a constrained environment. By simulating the process while considering the best strategy for each senator at each step, we can determine which party will ultimately be able to declare victory and make the decision on the change in the Dota2 game.

> def reach_position(n, p, banned, k):<br>    """You are given an integer `n` and an integer `p` in the range `[0, n - 1]`. Representing a 0-indexed array `arr` of length `n` where all positions are set to `0`'s, except position `p` which is set to `1`.<br><br>You are also given an integer array `banned` containing some positions from the array. For the ith position in `banned`, `arr[banned[i]] = 0`, and `banned[i] != p`.<br><br>You can perform multiple operations on `arr`. In an operation, you can choose a subarray with size `k` and reverse the subarray. However, the `1` in `arr` should never go to any of the positions in `banned`. In other words, after each operation `arr[banned[i]]` remains `0`.<br><br>_Return an array_ `ans` _where_ _for each_ `i` _from_ `[0, n - 1]`, `ans[i]` _is the minimum number of reverse operations needed to bring the_ `1` _to position_ `i` _in arr_, _or_ `-1` _if it is impossible_.<br><br>   A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.<br>   The values of `ans[i]` are independent for all `i`'s.<br>   The reverse of an array is an array containing the values in reverse order.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = \[1,2\], k = 4<br>Output: \[0,-1,-1,1\]<br>Explanation: In this case `k = 4` so there is only one possible reverse operation we can perform, which is reversing the whole array. Initially, 1 is placed at position 0 so the amount of operations we need for position 0 is `0`. We can never place a 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is `-1`. Finally, with one reverse operation we can bring the 1 to index 3, so the answer for position 3 is `1`. <br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: n = 5, p = 0, banned = \[2,4\], k = 3<br>Output: \[0,-1,-1,-1,-1\]<br>Explanation: In this case the 1 is initially at position 0, so the answer for that position is `0`. We can perform reverse operations of size 3. The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray `[0, 2]` for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions `-1`. <br><br>Example 3:<br><br>Input: n = 4, p = 2, banned = \[0,1,3\], k = 1<br>Output: \[-1,-1,0,-1\]<br>Explanation: In this case we can only perform reverse operations of size 1.
