# Query `126`

## Original Question

*You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where you can move from a cell to any adjacent cell in all `4` directions.

Return _the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid such that you can start from any cell and end at any cell._ Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.

Two paths are considered different if they do not have exactly the same sequence of visited cells.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[1,1\],\[3,4\]\]
Output: 8
Explanation: The strictly increasing paths are:
- Paths with length 1: \[1\], \[1\], \[3\], \[4\].
- Paths with length 2: \[1 -> 3\], \[1 -> 4\], \[3 -> 4\].
- Paths with length 3: \[1 -> 3 -> 4\].
The total number of paths is 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[1\],\[2\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation: The strictly increasing paths are:
- Paths with length 1: \[1\], \[2\].
- Paths with length 2: \[1 -> 2\].
The total number of paths is 2 + 1 = 3.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 1000`
   `1 <= m  n <= 105`
   `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to find the total number of strictly increasing paths in a given 2D grid where you can start and end at any cell, and you can move in all 4 directions (up, down, left, and right). A strictly increasing path means that each step in the path must go to a cell with a higher value than the current cell.

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization and depth-first search (DFS). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible solution:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

First, we need to understand that a path can start from any cell and can move to any of the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right) if the adjacent cell has a strictly greater value. The path can end at any cell. 

### Step 2: Creating a Memoization Table

We need a 2D array (or a similar structure) of the same size as the input grid to store the number of strictly increasing paths that start from each cell. This memoization table helps us avoid recalculating the number of paths for cells we've already processed.

### Step 3: Sorting Cells by Value

To efficiently find strictly increasing paths, we can sort all cells in the grid based on their values. This ensures that when we're calculating the paths starting from a given cell, we've already calculated the paths for all cells with smaller values. This is crucial for our DP approach because it respects the dependency order.

### Step 4: Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization

For each cell in our sorted list, we perform a DFS to find all strictly increasing paths starting from that cell. During the DFS, we use the memoization table to look up the number of paths for adjacent cells with higher values instead of recalculating them. This significantly reduces the computational complexity.

- **Base Case:** If we're at a cell and have already calculated the number of increasing paths from it (i.e., the memoization table at that cell's position is not empty), we simply return that value.
- **Recursive Step:** Otherwise, we look at all valid adjacent cells (those within bounds and with a strictly greater value). We add the number of paths from these adjacent cells to the current cell's count, applying the modulo `10^9 + 7` as required.

### Step 5: Summing Up All Paths

Since a path can start and end at any cell, the total number of strictly increasing paths in the grid is the sum of the number of paths starting from each cell. Thus, after filling our memoization table with the DFS and DP approach, we sum up all its values, applying the modulo as needed.

### Step 6: Modulo Operation

The problem statement asks for the result modulo `10^9 + 7`. This is a common practice to prevent integer overflow for problems with potentially large outputs. We need to apply this modulo operation at every step where the numbers could grow - during the summation in the DFS and when summing up all paths.

### Conclusion

This approach combines depth-first search for exploring all possible strictly increasing paths, dynamic programming for efficiently caching and reusing computed results, and sorting to ensure we process cells in an order that respects their dependencies. The final result is obtained by summing the computed paths for all cells, adhering to the modulo requirement to handle large numbers.
