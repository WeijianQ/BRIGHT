# Query `23`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the `ith` matchstick. You want to use all the matchsticks to make one square. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

Return `true` if you can make this square and `false` otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: matchsticks = \[1,1,2,2,2\]
Output: true
Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.

Example 2:

Input: matchsticks = \[3,3,3,3,4\]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.

Constraints:

   `1 <= matchsticks.length <= 15`
   `1 <= matchsticks[i] <= 108`*

## gpt4 Reasoning

```markdown
The essential problem here is to determine whether all the given matchsticks can be arranged in such a way that they form a square. This means each side of the square must be of equal length, and every matchstick must be used exactly once without breaking any. To solve this problem, we need to consider both the total length of the matchsticks and how they can be partitioned into four equal groups (each representing a side of the square).

### Step 1: Check Total Length
First, we need to check if the total length of all matchsticks is a multiple of 4 because the perimeter of the square must be evenly divided into four equal sides. If the total length is not divisible by 4, we can immediately return `false`, as it would be impossible to form a square.

### Step 2: Sorting
Sorting the matchsticks in descending order can be helpful. This is because using the longer matchsticks first might make it easier to determine earlier if forming a square is not possible, potentially reducing the number of combinations that need to be checked.

### Step 3: Recursive Backtracking
After ensuring the total length is divisible by 4, we know what the target length for each side of the square should be. The problem then reduces to a recursive search problem, where we try to create four groups of matchsticks, each summing up to the target length. This is often solved using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking, where we try to place each matchstick into one of the four sides and explore the possibility. If at any point, a matchstick cannot fit into any side without exceeding the target length, we backtrack and try a different arrangement.

### Step 4: Avoiding Redundancies
To make the search efficient, it's important to avoid redundant checks. For instance, if a matchstick didn't fit in a specific position, trying another matchstick of the same length immediately after won't change the outcome. Implementing pruning strategies to skip unnecessary checks can significantly reduce the search space and computation time.

### Conclusion
In summary, solving this problem involves:
1. Checking if the total length of matchsticks is divisible by 4.
2. Sorting the matchsticks in descending order to facilitate easier and possibly quicker checks.
3. Using a recursive backtracking approach to try and partition the matchsticks into four groups each equal to a quarter of the total length.
4. Implementing efficient strategies to avoid redundant checks and reduce the search space.

This problem is a classic example of a combinatorial search problem, where optimizing the search strategy and pruning the search space are key to finding a solution within a reasonable time frame.

That's why we can't just modulo 255, but we need another number above 255, which is called the prime polynomial.<br>    # Why so much hassle? Because we are using precomputed look-up tables for multiplication: instead of multiplying ab, we precompute alpha^a, alpha^b and alpha^(a+b), so that we can just use our lookup table at alpha^(a+b) and get our result. But just like in our original field we had 0,1,2,...,p-1 distinct unique values, in our "LUT" field using alpha we must have unique distinct values (we don't care that they are different from the original field as long as they are unique and distinct). That's why we need to avoid duplicated values, and to avoid duplicated values we need to use a prime irreducible polynomial.<br><br>    # Here is implemented a bruteforce approach to find all these prime polynomials, by generating every possible prime polynomials (ie, every integers between field_charac+1 and field_charac2), and then we build the whole Galois Field, and we reject the candidate prime polynomial if it duplicates even one value or if it generates a value above field_charac (ie, cause an overflow).<br>    # Note that this algorithm is slow if the field is too big (above 12), because it's an exhaustive search algorithm.

Hursts observations of the problem of long-term<br>    storage in water reservoirs. If x_i is the discharge of a river in year i<br>    and we observe this discharge for N years, we can calculate the storage<br>    capacity that would be required to keep the discharge steady at its mean<br>    value.<br><br>    To do so, we first substract the mean over all x_i from the individual<br>    x_i to obtain the departures x'_i from the mean for each year i. As the<br>    excess or deficit in discharge always carrys over from year i to year i+1,<br>    we need to examine the cumulative sum of x'_i, denoted by y_i. This<br>    cumulative sum represents the filling of our hypothetical storage. If the<br>    sum is above 0, we are storing excess discharge from the river, if it is<br>    below zero we have compensated a deficit in discharge by releasing<br>    water from the storage. The range (maximum - minimum) R of y_i therefore<br>    represents the total capacity required for the storage.<br><br>    Hurst showed that this value follows a steady trend for varying N if it<br>    is normalized by the standard deviation sigma over the x_i. Namely he<br>    obtained the following formula:<br><br>    R/sigma = (N/2)^K<br><br>    In this equation, K is called the Hurst exponent. Its value is 0.5 for<br>    white noise, but becomes greater for time series that exhibit some positive<br>    dependency on previous values. For negative dependencies it becomes less<br>    than 0.5.<br><br>  Explanation of the algorithm:<br>    The rescaled range (R/S) approach is directly derived from Hurst's<br>    definition. The time series of length N is split into non-overlapping<br>    subseries of length n. Then, R and S (S = sigma) are calculated for each<br>    subseries and the mean is taken over all subseries yielding (R/S)_n. This<br>    process is repeated for several lengths n. Finally, the exponent K is<br>    obtained by fitting a straight line to the plot of log((R/S)_n) vs log(n).<br><br>    There seems to be no consensus how to chose the subseries lenghts n.<br>    This function therefore leaves the choice to the user.

The length is reduced by at<br>             most 1% to find the value that has the most divisors.<br><br>              The "Simple R/S" estimate is just log((R/S)_n) / log(n) for <br>               n = N.<br>              The "theoretical Hurst exponent" is the value that would be<br>               expected of an uncorrected rescaled range approach for random<br>               noise of the size of the input data.<br>              The "empirical Hurst exponent" is the uncorrected Hurst exponent<br>               obtained by the rescaled range approach.<br>              The "corrected empirical Hurst exponent" is the Anis-Lloyd-Peters<br>               corrected Hurst exponent, but with sqrt(1/2  pi  n) added to<br>               the (R/S)_n before the log.<br>              The "corrected R over S Hurst exponent" uses the R-function "lm"<br>               instead of pracmas own "polyfit" and uses n = N/2, N/4, N/8, ...<br>               by successively halving the subsequences (which means that some<br>               subsequences may be one element longer than others).
