## Original Question

*If human eyes watch an area, what's the shape of its capturing shape? Rectangular? Half spherical?
A normal camera can capture a rectangular image. If human eyes watch an area, what's the shape of the captured region? Rectangular? Half-spherical?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding the shape of the area captured by human vision when looking at a scene. This involves comprehending how human eyes perceive the world around us and translating that into a geometric description. Let's break down the components and relevant information needed to address this question.

### Step 1: Understanding Human Vision

Human vision is complex, involving both the physical structures of the eyes and the processing power of the brain. The eyes act like cameras, but with some key differences:

- **Field of View**: Human eyes have a wide field of view. Each eye can see over 180 degrees horizontally when considering peripheral vision, though much of this is peripheral and not in sharp focus. Vertically, the field of view is slightly narrower.

- **Binocular Overlap**: Humans have two forward-facing eyes, providing a binocular field of view where the visions from each eye overlap. This overlapping area is what allows for depth perception. The combined effective field of view for both eyes together is less than 360 degrees due to this overlap.

- **Foveal Vision**: The center of our visual field, where we can see in high resolution, is quite narrow, roughly 1-2 degrees of visual angle. This area is surrounded by the peripheral vision, which is not as sharp but excellent at detecting motion.

### Step 2: Shape of the Captured Region

Given the characteristics of human vision:

- **Not Rectangular**: Unlike a camera, which captures a defined rectangular image, the shape of the region captured by human eyes isn't a neat rectangle. The periphery extends out, giving more of a rounded shape to the edges of our vision.

- **Not Perfectly Half-Spherical**: Although the description of a "half-spherical" field of view might intuitively seem to fit because of our nearly 180-degree horizontal field of view, this isn't entirely accurate either. The spherical model doesn't account for the irregularities of peripheral vision's extent and clarity or the binocular overlap.

### Step 3: Describing the Shape

The actual shape of the area captured by human vision is complex and doesn't fit neatly into simple geometric categories. It's more accurate to describe it as an irregular, somewhat oval shape with blurred boundaries due to the gradual decrease in visual acuity towards the periphery. This shape is wide horizontally, narrower vertically, and the most detailed portion is a small, central area where the two fields of view from our eyes overlap.

### Conclusion

The shape of the captured region by human eyes is not straightforwardly rectangular or half-spherical. It's a unique, irregular, oval-like shape that accounts for the wide field of view, binocular overlap, and the distinction between central and peripheral vision. This complexity reflects the sophisticated nature of human vision, which is designed to provide a broad awareness of our surroundings while focusing on details in the area where our attention is directed.

This is because the density of receptor and ganglion cells in the retina is greater at the center and lowest at the edges, and, moreover, the representation in the visual cortex is much smaller than that of the fovea (see visual system for an explanation of these concepts). The distribution of receptor cells across the retina is different between the two main types, rod cells and cone cells. Rod cells are unable to distinguish color and peak in density in the near periphery (at 18° eccentricity), while cone cell density is highest in the very center, the fovea. Note that this does not mean  that there is a lack of cones representing in the periphery; colors can be distinguished in peripheral vision.<br>Flicker fusion thresholds decline towards the periphery, but do that at a lower rate than other visual functions; so the periphery has a relative advantage at noticing flicker.

> Peripheral vision, or indirect vision, is vision as it occurs outside the point of fixation, i.e. away from the center of gaze or, when viewed at large angles, in (or out of) the "corner of one's eye". The vast majority of the area in the visual field is included in the notion of peripheral vision. "Far peripheral" vision refers to the area at the edges of the visual field, "mid-peripheral" vision refers to medium eccentricities, and "near-peripheral", sometimes referred to as "para-central" vision, exists adjacent to the center of gaze.
