## Original Question

*How are our senses dimmed during sleep?
Our senses are not as sensitive during sleep compared to wake. There is an arousal threshold during sleep that only when it is overcome will it wake a person up. My question is how is this arousal threshold lowered as sleep progresses? And how it is raised again during the latter stages of sleep?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding the mechanisms behind the modulation of sensory perception during sleep, specifically how the arousal threshold is adjusted throughout different stages of sleep. To address this, we need to explore how sleep progresses through its stages, the physiological changes associated with these stages, and how these changes affect our sensory perception and response to external stimuli.

1. **Understanding Sleep Stages**: Sleep is divided into non-REM (NREM) and REM stages. NREM sleep itself is further categorized into stages N1, N2, and N3, with N3 being the deepest stage of sleep. REM sleep is where most dreaming occurs. The progression through these stages in cycles affects our brain's responsiveness to external stimuli.

2. **Changes in Brain Activity**: Each sleep stage is characterized by different brain wave patterns. For instance, N3 stage of NREM sleep shows delta waves, indicative of deep sleep. During REM sleep, brain activity is similar to wakefulness, but muscle atonia prevents most physical response to dreams. These patterns in brain activity correlate with the brain's receptiveness to external stimuli and the threshold for arousal.

3. **Adjustment of the Arousal Threshold**:
   - **Lowering the Threshold in Early Sleep**: As we transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep, particularly into the deeper N3 stage, the arousal threshold increases. This means we are less responsive to external stimuli due to significant slowing down of brain activity and physiological processes. Factors like the release of certain neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA) contribute to inhibiting the brain's responsiveness.
   - **Changes Through the Night**: The arousal threshold is not static throughout the night. It fluctuates, generally being highest during deep NREM sleep (N3) and lower during REM sleep and lighter stages of NREM sleep (N1 and N2). This is why, in the early part of the night when deep NREM sleep predominates, we are less likely to be awakened by external stimuli compared to later in the night or early morning when lighter sleep stages and REM sleep are more common.
   - **Raising the Threshold Again**: In the latter part of the night, as the proportion of REM sleep increases and the depth of NREM sleep decreases, our arousal threshold lowers. This means we become more responsive to external stimuli and more easily awakened. However, it's important to note that even during REM sleep, when our brain activity resembles wakefulness, we can still exhibit a significant threshold for arousal due to muscle atonia and the brain's focus on internal dream content.

4. **Physiological Mechanisms**: The modulation of the arousal threshold is likely controlled by complex interactions between various neurotransmitter systems (e.g., acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine) and the brain's sleep-regulating centers, such as the hypothalamus. These systems work together to balance the need for sleep and the need to respond to critical external stimuli.

5. **External Factors**: It's also worth noting that external factors can influence the arousal threshold. For example, noise level, room temperature, and even pre-sleep stress or anxiety can affect how deeply we sleep and how easily we can be awakened.

In summary, the modulation of our sensory perception and the arousal threshold during sleep is a dynamic process, influenced by the progression through different sleep stages, brain activity patterns, neurotransmitter systems, and external environmental factors. Understanding this complex interplay helps explain why we might sleep through loud noises at one point in the night but awaken from a faint sound at another.

> sleep is characterized by high cortical delta power, whereas light NREM sleep and REM sleep are characterized by low delta power (Brandenberger et al., 2001). Reciprocal changes in sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation tone are correlated with the cortical delta power within a sleep cycle (Brandenberger et al., 2001). The ratio of sleep stages and activity levels of cortical and autonomic systems in a sleep cycle gradually change from the initial to late periods of sleep cycles (Dement and Wolpert, 1958; Feinberg, 1974; Brandenberger et al., 2001; Versace et al

The ascending impulses originating in the brainstem during REM sleep may be required in promoting neuronal differentiation, maturation, and myelination in higher brain centers as well as the maturation of the cardiorespiratory regulating center within the brainstem. Thus, the abundance of REM sleep in early life and its ensuing decline to lower levels in adulthood strongly suggest that REM sleep is an integral part of the activity-dependent processes that enable normal physiological and structural

Its function also includes processing information relating to the sense of touch.  Portions of the parietal lobe are involved with visuospatial processing. Although multisensory in nature, the posterior parietal cortex is often referred to by vision scientists as the dorsal stream of vision (as opposed to the ventral stream in the temporal lobe). This dorsal stream has been called both the "where" stream (as in spatial vision) and the "how" stream (as in vision for action). The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) receives somatosensory and visual input, which then, through motor signals, controls movement of the arm, hand, and eyes.<br>Various studies in the 1990s found that different regions of the posterior parietal cortex in macaques represent different parts of space.<br>The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area contains a map of neurons (retinotopically-coded when the eyes are fixed) representing the saliency of spatial locations, and attention to these spatial locations.

Bilateral damage to this brain region does not cause amnesia however the strength of memory is diminished, details of complex events become harder to retrieve, and subjective confidence in memory is very low.
