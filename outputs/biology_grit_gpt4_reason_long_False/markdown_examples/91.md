## Original Question

*If Tumors have lots of mutations in them how is it the immune system can't detect them?
If a cancerous tumor has a lot of mutations in them why can't the immune system detect them? If a person has cancer could this somehow alter the person's immune system so it doesn't function effectively to detect greatly mutated cells? Does the fact that a tumor is 'made' of 'mutated' non-foreign human cells help it to be undetectable?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

### Essential Problem:

The core issue here is understanding why the immune system, despite its complexity and capability to detect and eliminate abnormal cells, often fails to recognize and destroy cancerous tumors that contain a high number of mutations.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Nature of Tumors and Mutations:**
   - Tumors are masses of abnormal cells that have proliferated uncontrollably. These cells often accumulate mutations, some of which can make them appear different from normal cells. Theoretically, the immune system should recognize these mutated cells as abnormal and eliminate them.

2. **Immune System Function:**
   - The immune system is highly adept at distinguishing self from non-self entities. It eliminates pathogens and infected cells while usually sparing the body's own cells. However, since cancer cells originate from the body's own cells, they may not be recognized as foreign, even if they are highly mutated.

3. **Cancer Cell Evasion Tactics:**
   - **Immunosuppressive Environment:** Tumors can create a local environment that suppresses immune responses. They can secrete chemicals that inhibit the activity of immune cells or recruit cells that suppress immune responses.
   - **Immune Editing:** Cancer cells can undergo a process called "immune editing," where the immune system eliminates the most recognizable cancer cells, but those that are less visible to the immune system survive and proliferate.
   - **Antigen Presentation:** The effectiveness of the immune system in recognizing cancer cells partly depends on the presentation of tumor antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Mutations can affect this process, either by reducing the presentation of antigens or by altering the antigens in a way that the immune system no longer recognizes them as abnormal.
   - **Molecular Mimicry:** Cancer cells can mimic normal cells, making it difficult for the immune system to detect them as abnormal. This is partly because they are indeed the body's own cells, albeit mutated.

4. **Impact of Cancer on the Immune System:**
   - Chronic immune activation by cancer can lead to immune exhaustion, where the immune cells become less effective over time. Additionally, certain cancers can directly impair immune cell function or production, further diminishing the immune response.

5. **Genetic Diversity within Tumors:**
   - The high mutation rate in tumors leads to genetic diversity within the tumor itself, a phenomenon known as tumor heterogeneity. This diversity means that even if the immune system targets one set of cancer cell antigens, other cells with different mutations might escape detection and destruction.

### Conclusion:

While it seems counterintuitive that the immune system cannot always detect and eliminate cancer cells despite their numerous mutations, the reality is that tumors have developed sophisticated mechanisms to evade immune detection. These mechanisms include creating an immunosuppressive environment, immune editing, affecting antigen presentation, and molecular mimicry. Furthermore, the fact that cancer cells originate from the body's own cells complicates the immune system's ability to recognize them as threats. The immune system's struggle against cancer is not due to a lack of effort but rather to the complex interplay of evolutionary pressures that have allowed tumors to become adept at surviving and proliferating despite the body's defenses.

> Proteins[edit]<br>T-cell receptor complexed with MHC-I and MHC-II<br>MHC class I[edit]<br>Main article: MHC class I<br>MHC class I molecules are expressed in some nucleated cells and also in platelets—in essence all cells but red blood cells. It presents epitopes to killer T cells, also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). A CTL expresses CD8 receptors, in addition to T-cell receptors (TCR)s. When a CTL's CD8 receptor docks to a MHC class I molecule, if the CTL's TCR fits the epitope within the MHC class I molecule, the CTL triggers the cell to undergo programmed cell death by apoptosis. Thus, MHC class I helps mediate cellular immunity, a primary means to address intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria, including bacterial L forms, bacterial genus Mycoplasma, and bacterial genus Rickettsia. In humans, MHC class I comprises HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C molecules.<br>The first crystal structure of Class I MHC molecule, human HLA-A2, was published in 1989. The structure revealed that MHC-I molecules are heterodimers, they have polymorphic heavy α-subunit whose gene occurs inside the MHC locus and small invariant β2 microglobulin subunit whose gene is located usually outside of it. Polymorphic heavy chain of MHC-I molecule contains N-terminal extra-cellular  region composed by three domains, α1, α2, and α3, transmembrane helix to hold MHC-I molecule on the cell surface and short cytoplasmic tail. Two domains, α1 and α2 form deep peptide-binding groove between two long α-helices and the floor of the groove formed by eight β-strands. Immunoglobulin-like domain α3 involved in the interaction with CD8 co-receptor. β2 microglobulin provides stability of the complex and participates in the recognition of peptide-MHC class I complex by CD8 co-receptor.  The peptide is non-covalently bound to MHC-I, it is held by the several pockets on the floor of the peptide-binding groove. Amino acid side-chains that are most polymorphic in human alleles fill up the central and widest portion of the binding groove, while conserved side-chains are clustered at the narrower ends of the groove.<br>Schematic view of MHC class I and MHC class II molecules<br>Classical MHC molecules present epitopes to the TCRs of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Nonclassical molecules (MHC class IB) exhibit limited polymorphism, expression patterns, and presented antigens; this group is subdivided into a group encoded within MHC loci (e.g., HLA-E, -F, -G), as well as those not (e.g., stress ligands such as ULBPs, Rae1, and H60); the antigen/ligand for many of these molecules remain unknown, but they can interact with each of CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. The evolutionary oldest nonclassical MHC class I lineage in human was deduced to be the lineage that includes the CD1 and PROCR (alias EPCR) molecules and this lineage may have been established before the origin of tetrapod species. However, the only nonclassical MHC class I lineage for which evidence exists that it was established before the evolutionary separation of Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish plus tetrapods) is lineage Z of which members are found, together in each species with classical MHC class I, in lungfish and throughout ray-finned fishes; why the Z lineage was well conserved in ray-finned fish but lost in tetrapods is not understood.<br>MHC class II[edit]<br><br>Main article: MHC class II<br>MHC class II can be conditionally expressed by all cell types, but normally occurs only on "professional" antigen-presenting cells (APCs): macrophages, B cells, and especially dendritic cells (DCs). An APC takes up an antigenic protein, performs antigen processing, and returns a molecular fraction of it—a fraction termed the epitope—and displays it on the APC's surface coupled within an MHC class II molecule (antigen presentation). On the cell's surface, the epitope can be recognized by immunologic structures like T-cell receptors (TCRs). The molecular region which binds to the epitope is the paratope.<br>On surfaces of helper T cells are CD4 receptors, as well as TCRs. When a naive helper T cell's CD4 molecule docks to an APC's MHC class II molecule, its TCR can meet and bind the epitope coupled within the MHC class II. This event primes the naive T cell. According to the local milieu, that is, the balance of cytokines secreted by APCs in the microenvironment, the naive helper T cell (Th0) polarizes into either a memory Th cell or an effector Th cell of phenotype either type 1 (Th1), type 2 (Th2), type 17 (Th17), or regulatory/suppressor (Treg), as so far identified, the Th cell's terminal differentiation.<br>MHC class II thus mediates immunization to—or, if APCs polarize Th0 cells principally to Treg cells, immune tolerance of—an antigen. The polarization during primary exposure to an antigen is key in determining a number of chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and asthma, by skewing the immune response that memory Th cells coordinate when their memory recall is triggered upon secondary exposure to similar antigens. B cells express MHC class II to present antigens to Th0, but when their B cell receptors bind matching epitopes, interactions which are not mediated by MHC, these activated B cells secrete soluble immunoglobulins: antibody molecules mediating humoral immunity.<br>Class II MHC molecules are also heterodimers, genes for both α and β subunits are polymorphic and located  within MHC class II subregion. Peptide-binding groove of MHC-II molecules is forms by N-terminal domains of both subunits of the heterodimer, α1 and β1, unlike MHC-I molecules, where two domains of the same chain are involved. In addition, both subunits of MHC-II contain transmembrane helix and immunoglobulin domains α2 or β2 that can be recognized by CD4 co-receptors. In this way MHC molecules chaperone which type of lymphocytes may bind to the given antigen with high affinity, since different lymphocytes express different T-Cell Receptor (TCR) co-receptors.<br>MHC class II molecules in humans have five to six isotypes. Classical molecules present peptides to CD4+ lymphocytes. Nonclassical molecules, accessories, with intracellular functions, are not exposed on cell membranes, but in internal membranes, assisting with the loading of antigenic peptides onto classic MHC class II molecules. The important nonclassical MHC class II molecule DM is only found from the evolutionary level of lungfish, although also in more primitive fishes both classical and nonclassical MHC class II are found.<br>Sr.No<br><br>Feature<br><br>Class I MHC<br><br>Class II MHC<br><br><br>1<br><br>Constituting polypeptide chains<br><br>α chain (45KDa in humans)<br>β2 chain (12 KDa in humans)<br><br><br>α chain (30–34 KDa in humans)<br>β chain (26–29 KDa in humans)<br><br><br><br>2<br><br>Antigen binding domain<br><br>α1and α2 domains<br><br>α1 and β1 domains<br><br><br>3<br><br>Binds protein antigens of<br><br>8–10 amino acids residues<br><br>13–18 amino acids residues<br><br><br>4<br><br>Peptide bending cleft<br><br>Floor formed by β sheets and sides by α<br>helices, blocked at both the ends<br><br><br>Floor formed by β sheets and sides by α<br>helices, opened at both the ends<br><br><br><br>5<br><br>Antigenic peptide motifs<br>involved in binding<br><br><br>Anchor residues located at amino and<br>carbon terminal ends<br><br><br>Anchor residues located almost uniformly<br>along the peptide<br><br><br><br>6<br><br>Presents antigenic peptide to<br><br>CD8+ T cells<br><br>CD4+ T cells<br>MHC class III[edit]<br><br>Main article: MHC class III<br>Class III molecules have physiologic roles unlike classes I and II, but are encoded between them in the short arm of human chromosome 6. Class III molecules include several secreted proteins with immune functions: components of the complement system (such as C2, C4, and B factor), cytokines (such as TNF-α, LTA, and LTB), and heat shock proteins.<br>Function[edit]<br>MHC is the tissue-antigen that allows the immune system (more specifically T cells) to bind to, recognize, and tolerate itself (autorecognition). MHC is also the chaperone for intracellular peptides that are complexed with MHCs and presented to T cell receptors (TCRs) as potential foreign antigens. MHC interacts with TCR and its co-receptors to optimize binding conditions for the TCR-antigen interaction, in terms of antigen binding affinity and specificity, and signal transduction effectiveness.<br>Essentially, the MHC-peptide complex is a complex of auto-antigen/allo-antigen. Upon binding, T cells should in principle tolerate the auto-antigen, but activate when exposed to the allo-antigen. Disease states occur when this principle is disrupted.<br>Antigen presentation: MHC molecules bind to both T cell receptor and CD4/CD8 co-receptors on T lymphocytes, and the antigen epitope held in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule interacts with the variable Ig-Like domain of the TCR to trigger T-cell activation<br>Autoimmune reaction: Having some MHC molecules increases the risk of autoimmune diseases more than having others. HLA-B27 is an example. It is unclear how exactly having the HLA-B27 tissue type increases the risk of ankylosing spondylitis and other associated inflammatory diseases, but mechanisms involving aberrant antigen presentation or T cell activation have been hypothesized.<br>Tissue allorecognition: MHC molecules in complex with peptide epitopes are essentially ligands for TCRs. T cells become activated by binding to the peptide-binding grooves of any MHC molecule that they were not trained to recognize during positive selection in the thymus.

> The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a large locus on vertebrate DNA containing a set of closely linked polymorphic genes that code for cell surface proteins essential for the adaptive immune system. These cell surface proteins are called MHC molecules.<br>The name of this locus comes from its discovery through the study of transplanted tissue compatibility. Later studies revealed that tissue rejection due to incompatibility is only a facet of the full function of MHC molecules: binding an antigen derived from self-proteins, or from pathogens, and bringing the antigen presentation to the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate the interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines donor compatibility for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.<br>In a cell, protein molecules of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a small peptide (a molecular fraction of a protein) called an epitope. The presented self-antigens prevent an organism's immune system from targeting its own cells. The presentation of pathogen-derived proteins results in the elimination of the infected cell by the immune system.<br>Diversity of an individual's self-antigen presentation, mediated by MHC self-antigens, is attained in at least three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repertoire is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); (3) MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Sexual selection has been observed in male mice choosing to mate with females with different MHCs. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing, which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.

> In transplant rejection[edit]<br>In a transplant procedure, as of an organ or stem cells, MHC molecules themselves act as antigens and can provoke immune response in the recipient, thus causing transplant rejection. MHC molecules were identified and named after their role in transplant rejection between mice of different strains, though it took over 20 years to clarify MHC's role in presenting peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).<br>Each human cell expresses six MHC class I alleles (one HLA-A, -B, and -C allele from each parent) and six to eight MHC class II alleles (one HLA-DP and -DQ, and one or two HLA-DR from each parent, and combinations of these). The MHC variation in the human population is high, at least 350 alleles for HLA-A genes, 620 alleles for HLA-B, 400 alleles for DR, and 90 alleles for DQ. Any two individuals who are not identical twins, triplets, or higher order multiple births, will express differing MHC molecules. All MHC molecules can mediate transplant rejection, but HLA-C and HLA-DP, showing low polymorphism, seem least important.<br>When maturing in the thymus, T lymphocytes are selected for their TCR incapacity to recognize self antigens, yet T lymphocytes can react against the donor MHC's peptide-binding groove, the variable region of MHC holding the presented antigen's epitope for recognition by TCR, the matching paratope. T lymphocytes of the recipient take the incompatible peptide-binding groove as nonself antigen.<br>Transplant rejection has various types known to be mediated by MHC (HLA):<br>Hyperacute rejection occurs when, before the transplantation, the recipient has preformed anti-HLA antibodies, perhaps by previous blood transfusions (donor tissue that includes lymphocytes expressing HLA molecules), by anti-HLA generated during pregnancy (directed at the father's HLA displayed by the fetus), or by previous transplantation;<br>Acute cellular rejection occurs when the recipient's T lymphocytes are activated by the donor tissue, causing damage via mechanisms such as direct cytotoxicity from CD8 cells.<br>Acute humoral rejection and chronic disfunction occurs when the recipient's anti-HLA antibodies form directed at HLA molecules present on endothelial cells of the transplanted tissue.<br>In all of the above situations, immunity is directed at the transplanted organ, sustaining lesions. A cross-reaction test between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed. The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate. Global databases of donor information enhance the search for compatible donors.<br>The involvement in allogeneic transplant rejection appears to be an ancient feature of MHC molecules, because also in fish associations between transplant rejections and (mis-)matching of MHC class I and MHC class II were observed.
