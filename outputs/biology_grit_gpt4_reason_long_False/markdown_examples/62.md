## Original Question

*How does a neuron change as you learn?
I am currently taking a course called "Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3", and I have a question about how well the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm for a "neural network" corresponds with how an actual neuron works.
In the course, they model a neuron like this: AI implementation of a neuron's algorithm
x1, x2, etc. are voltage inputs, the wij are weights. The inputs are multiplied by these weights and summed up by the neuron. The neuron then has an "activation function" which then takes the sum of weighted inputs and calculates an output, typically a value between 0 and 1 (or between -1 and 1). You can think of the wij as representing dendrites (a higher weight means a more dense and thus conductive dendrite), and the output of the activation function as the voltage that gets sent down an axon.
The AI neural network algorithm creates a kind of intelligence by modifying the weights (wij shown in the picture).
My first questions is: Is this a good approximation as to how neurons actually work? That is, do our neurons "learn" by changing the weights (dendrite density, conductivity)? Or, is there some other mechanism that is more important (e.g. do neurons learn by changing their activation or summation functions?)
My second question is: If neurons really do learn by changing the density of dendrites, then how fast does this happen? Is this a fast process like DNA replication? Does the neuron quickly generate (or decrease) dendrite density when it receives some kind of biochemical signal that it needs to learn now?
I understand that much of this might not yet be known, but would like to know how well the AI algorithm corresponds with current theories on biological neural networks.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

Your inquiry delves into the fascinating intersection between artificial neural networks (ANNs) used in machine learning and the biological neural networks found in the human brain. Let's address your questions step by step.

### Is the AI Neuron Model a Good Approximation of How Real Neurons Work?

The AI implementation of a neuron you've described captures a simplified model of how biological neurons process information. In biological neurons, dendrites receive signals (analogous to the inputs in an ANN), and the neuron integrates these signals to determine whether to fire an action potential along its axon (similar to the output in an ANN). The concept of weights in ANNs parallels the strength of synaptic connections in biological neurons, where a stronger synaptic connection means a greater influence on the postsynaptic neuron's potential to fire.

However, the analogy has its limitations. Biological neurons and their networks are far more complex:

- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Learning in biological systems is primarily understood through synaptic plasticity, particularly long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which adjust the strength of synaptic connections. This is somewhat akin to changing weights in ANNs, but the mechanisms involve complex biochemical pathways.
  
- **Activation Functions**: Biological neurons don't have a simple, fixed "activation function." Their firing response involves intricate dynamics of ion channels and neurotransmitters. The decision to fire is not a smooth function of input sum but a threshold-based mechanism influenced by a myriad of factors.

- **Other Learning Mechanisms**: Beyond synaptic plasticity affecting dendrite strength/conductivity, neurons can also undergo structural changes, such as the growth of new dendritic spines or changes in the axon's efficiency. Moreover, learning involves changes at the network level, such as the formation of new synaptic connections or the pruning of others.

### How Fast Does This Change Happen?

Synaptic plasticity is not as fast as DNA replication but can occur relatively quickly in response to learning:

- **Rapid Changes**: Synaptic strength can change within minutes of a relevant stimulus. For example, LTP can begin to enhance synaptic strength within seconds to minutes of the triggering activity.

- **Structural Changes**: The growth of new dendritic spines or other structural changes to neurons can take longer, from hours to days. These changes are generally considered part of the consolidation phase of learning, where short-term memories or skills are stabilized into long-term ones.

### Summary

While the AI model of a neuron provides a useful framework for building artificial neural networks and understanding some aspects of information processing in biological systems, it simplifies the complex reality of how neurons and their networks operate. Biological neurons learn through a variety of mechanisms, with synaptic plasticity being a key process, but not the only one. The changes in synaptic strength and structure are more nuanced and involve a broad spectrum of biochemical and structural adjustments, occurring over timescales from minutes to days.

In conclusion, while ANNs draw inspiration from biological neural networks, the analogy is more conceptual than literal. Both fields, however, continue to inform each other, with neuroscience insights leading to new AI models and AI research offering tools to analyze and understand the brain's incredibly complex networks.

> Hebbian engrams and cell assembly theory[edit]<br>Hebbian theory concerns how neurons might connect themselves to become engrams. Hebb's theories on the form and function of cell assemblies can be understood from the following:<br>The general idea is an old one, that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become 'associated' so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other.<br>Hebb also wrote:<br>When one cell repeatedly assists in firing another, the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs (or enlarges them if they already exist) in contact with the soma of the second cell.<br>[D. Alan Allport] posits additional ideas regarding cell assembly theory and its role in forming engrams, along the lines of the concept of auto-association, described as follows:<br>If the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly, the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly inter-associated. That is, each element will tend to turn on every other element and (with negative weights) to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern. To put it another way, the pattern as a whole will become 'auto-associated'.  We may call a learned (auto-associated) pattern an engram.<br>Work in the laboratory of Eric Kandel has provided evidence for the involvement of Hebbian learning mechanisms at synapses in the marine gastropod Aplysia californica. Experiments on Hebbian synapse modification mechanisms at the central nervous system synapses of vertebrates are much more difficult to control than are experiments with the relatively simple peripheral nervous system synapses studied in marine invertebrates. Much of the work on long-lasting synaptic changes between vertebrate neurons (such as long-term potentiation) involves the use of non-physiological experimental stimulation of brain cells. However, some of the physiologically relevant synapse modification mechanisms that have been studied in vertebrate brains do seem to be examples of Hebbian processes. One such study reviews results from experiments that indicate that long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths can be induced by physiologically relevant synaptic activity working through both Hebbian and non-Hebbian mechanisms.

> Hebbian theory is a neuropsychological theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell. It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity, the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process. It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior. The theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory. Hebb states it as follows:<br>The theory is often summarized as "Cells that fire together wire together." However, Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to "take part in firing" cell B, and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before, not at the same time as, cell B. This aspect of causation in Hebb's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which requires temporal precedence.<br>The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning, in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells. It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation. In the study of neural networks in cognitive function, it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning.
