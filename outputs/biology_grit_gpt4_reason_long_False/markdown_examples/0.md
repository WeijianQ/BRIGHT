## Original Question

*Claim in article about why insects are attracted to light
In this article they are addressing the reason insects are attracted to light when they say
Heat radiation as an attractive component is refuted by the effect of LED lighting, which supplies negligible infrared radiation yet still entraps vast numbers of insects.
I don't see why attraction to LEDs shows they're not seeking heat. Could they for example be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat? So that even though they don't encounter heat near/on the LEDs they still "expect" to?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why insects are attracted to LED lights, which emit negligible amounts of infrared radiation (heat), if the common belief is that insects are drawn to lights due to their seeking heat. The question raises the possibility that insects could be evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat, leading them to be attracted to LED lights even in the absence of heat.

**Step 1: Understanding Insect Attraction to Light**

First, it's important to understand the various theories behind why insects are attracted to artificial lights, including LEDs. Two main hypotheses have been proposed in scientific literature: 

1. **Phototaxis**: This is the movement of an organism toward or away from a light source. Positive phototaxis means moving towards the light, which is commonly observed in many flying insects. The reasons behind phototaxis can vary, including seeking warmth, using light for navigation, or being attracted to wavelengths of light that are prominent in their natural environments.

2. **Evolutionary Association Between Light and Heat**: Insects, being ectothermic organisms, rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. Historically, the primary sources of light in the night environment (moonlight, starlight, and occasionally fire) also emitted heat. It's plausible that insects evolved to associate light with heat, aiding in their survival and reproductive success.

**Step 2: Considering the Role of LED Lights**

LED lights, while emitting light across various parts of the spectrum, typically emit very little infrared radiation compared to incandescent bulbs or flames. Despite this, many insects are still attracted to LED lighting. 

1. **Wavelength of Light**: It's possible that insects are attracted to specific wavelengths of light emitted by LEDs rather than to the heat. Many LEDs emit light in the blue to ultraviolet range, which can be particularly attractive to insects. This attraction could be due to the insects' visual systems being sensitive to these wavelengths, possibly because they mimic the wavelengths of light reflected or emitted by flowers or other important environmental cues.

2. **Evolutionary Programming**: The hypothesis that insects are evolutionarily programmed to associate light with heat is intriguing. While it's true that evolutionary traits can sometimes lag behind rapid environmental changes (like the introduction of artificial light), this alone may not fully explain the attraction to LEDs. This is because the evolutionary benefit derived from being attracted to light (if primarily for heat) would diminish if there is no heat to be found, potentially leading to a shift in behavior over many generations. However, the rapid introduction and widespread use of LED lights have not allowed sufficient time for such evolutionary adjustments.

**Step 3: Addressing the Problem**

To fully understand why insects are attracted to LED lights despite the lack of significant heat emission, several areas of research could be relevant:

1. **Spectral Sensitivity of Insects**: Research into which wavelengths of light are most attractive to different species of insects could help clarify whether LEDs' specific light spectra are more attractive regardless of heat emission.

2. **Behavioral Studies**: Observational studies on insect behavior around different light sources, including LEDs with varying wavelengths and heat emissions, could provide insight into their preferences and whether these are changing over time.

3. **Evolutionary Biology**: Further research into the evolutionary history of insects' attraction to light could reveal whether there is indeed a deep-seated association with heat, or if the attraction mechanisms are more complex and varied.

In conclusion, while the attraction of insects to LED lights despite their minimal heat emission challenges the notion that insects are primarily seeking warmth, it suggests that other factors, such as specific light wavelengths and possibly ingrained evolutionary behaviors, play a significant role. Understanding these complex interactions requires a multidisciplinary approach involving entomology, evolutionary biology, and physics.

> Phototaxis in invertebrates[edit]<br>Jellyfish[edit]<br>Positive and negative phototaxis can be found in several species of jellyfish such as those from the genus Polyorchis. Jellyfish use ocelli to detect the presence and absence of light, which is then translated into anti-predatory behaviour in the case of a shadow being cast over the ocelli, or feeding behaviour in the case of the presence of light. Many tropical jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic zooxanthellae that they harbor within their cells. The zooxanthellae nourish the jellyfish, while the jellyfish protects them, and moves them toward light sources such as the sun to maximize their light-exposure for efficient photosynthesis. In a shadow, the jellyfish can either remain still, or quickly move away in bursts to avoid predation and also re-adjust toward a new light source.<br>This motor response to light and absence of light is facilitated by a chemical response from the ocelli, which results in a motor response causing the organism to swim toward a light source.<br>Marine ragworm[edit]<br>Phototaxis and UV-avoidance of Platynereis dumerilii larvae responding to UV-light (380 nm) from above See text body for further explanation.<br>Phototaxis has been well studied in the marine ragworm Platynereis dumerilii.

The photoreceptor cell synapses directly onto ciliated cells, which are used for swimming. The eyespots do not give spatial resolution, therefore the larvae are rotating to scan their environment for the direction where the light is coming from.<br>Platynereis dumerilii larvae (nectochaete) can switch between positive and negative phototaxis. Phototaxis there is mediated by two pairs of more complex pigment cup eyes. These eyes contain more photoreceptor cells that are shaded by pigment cells forming a cup. The photoreceptor cells do not synapse directly onto ciliated cells or muscle cells but onto inter-neurons of a processing center. This way the information of all four eye cups can be compared and a low-resolution image of four pixels can be created telling the larvae where the light is coming from. This way the larva does not need to scan its environment by rotating. This is an adaption for living on the bottom of the sea the lifestyle of the larva while scanning rotation is more suited for living in the open water column, the lifestyle of the trochophore larva. Phototaxis in the Platynereis dumerilii larva has a broad spectral range which is at least covered by three opsins that are expressed by the cup eyes: Two rhabdomeric opsins and a Go-opsin.<br>Platynereis dumerilii<br>However, not every behavior that looks like phototaxis is phototaxis: Platynereis dumerilii nechtochate and metatrochophore larvae swim up first when they are stimulated with UV-light from above. But after a while, they change the direction and avoid the UV-light by swimming down. This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis (see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side. And so they do not swim to or away from the light, but swim down, this means to the center of gravity. Thus this is a UV-induced positive gravitaxis. Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths. Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost first, phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic depth gauge, which allows the larvae to determine their depth by the color of the surrounding water.

Drosophila melanogaster has been studied extensively for its innate positive phototactic response to light sources, using controlled experiments to help understand the connection between airborne locomotion toward a light source. This innate response is common among insects that fly primarily during the night utilizing transverse orientation vis-à-vis the light of the moon for orientation. Artificial lighting in cities and populated areas results in a more pronounced positive response compared to that with the distant light of the moon, resulting in the organism repeatedly responding to this new supernormal stimulus and innately flying toward it.<br>Evidence for the innate response of positive phototaxis in Drosophila melanogaster was carried out by altering the wings of several individual specimens, both physically (via removal) and genetically (via mutation).

Tenebrio molitor by comparison is one species which carries its negative phototaxis into adulthood.

Under homogeneous light conditions with a shifting magnetic field, Drosophila melanogaster larvae reorient themselves toward predicted directions of greater or lesser light intensities as expected by a rotating magnetic field. In complete darkness, the larvae orient randomly without any notable preference. This suggests the larvae can observe a visible pattern in combination with light.

> Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from a stimulus of light.

The first is called scotophobotaxis (from the word "scotophobia"), which is observed only under a microscope. This occurs when a bacterium swims by chance out of the area illuminated by the microscope. Entering darkness signals the cell to reverse flagella rotation direction and reenter the light. The second type of phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light. This is analogous to positive chemotaxis except that the attractant is light rather than a chemical.<br>Phototactic responses are observed in many organisms such as Serratia marcescens, Tetrahymena, and Euglena.
