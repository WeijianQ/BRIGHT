## Original Question

*Do animals exhibit handedness (paw-ness?) preference?
I have been observing my cat and found that when confronted with an unknown item, she will always use her front left paw to touch it.
This has me wondering if animals exhibit handedness like humans do? (and do I have a left handed cat?)
One note of importance is that with an unknown item, her approach is always identical, so possibly using the left paw means allowing a fast possible exit based on how she positions her body.
This question is related to Are there dextral/sinistral higher animals?. However, I question the "paw-ness" as a consequence of how the cat is approaching new items (to be ready to flee), whereas the other question remarks about the high number of "right-pawed" dogs and questions the influence of people for this preference.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

Your observations and questions touch upon a fascinating aspect of animal behavior known as "lateralization," which refers to the preference most animals (including humans) show for one side of their body over the other. In humans, this is commonly expressed as handedness. In animals, the concept can be extended to "pawedness," "footedness," or even "eyedness," depending on the species and context.

### Understanding Animal Lateralization

1. **Evidence of Lateralization in Animals:** Research has shown that many animals, including cats, dogs, rodents, and even birds, exhibit a preference for using one paw or side more than the other. This lateralization can manifest in various behaviors such as reaching for food, stepping down from a height, or, as in your cat's case, exploring new objects.

2. **Determining Paw Preference:** To ascertain whether an animal has a paw preference, scientists conduct specific tests where the animal is encouraged to perform a task that requires them to choose a paw. These tasks can be simple, like reaching for food inside a tube, or more complex, requiring problem-solving skills. Observations over multiple trials are needed to determine a preference, as a single action might be influenced by situational factors rather than inherent pawedness.

3. **Influence of Body Position:** You've noted an interesting point regarding your cat's body position when approaching new items, suggesting that her left-paw use might be strategic for a quick escape. While body positioning and environmental factors can influence which paw is used in a given situation, consistent use of one paw over many different contexts would suggest a genuine preference.

4. **Variability Among Animals:** Just as in humans, where handedness distribution is not evenly split (with a majority being right-handed), animals also show variability in their lateralization. However, the distribution can vary significantly across species and even within species, depending on the population and the tasks used to measure paw preference.

5. **Biological Basis and Evolutionary Implications:** The biological basis for lateralization is believed to be rooted in the brain's structure and function, where different hemispheres control different sides of the body and have specialized functions. This lateralization can offer evolutionary advantages, such as optimizing brain function by avoiding duplication of effort across hemispheres.

### Is Your Cat Left-Pawed?

Based on your observations, it's possible that your cat may have a preference for using her left paw, especially if this behavior is consistent across various activities and not just limited to exploring new items. However, to determine this more definitively, you might consider conducting informal experiments by presenting her with tasks that require her to use a paw, observing which paw she uses more frequently over multiple trials.

### Conclusion

Animals do exhibit lateralization, and your observations suggest that your cat might have a preference for using her left paw. However, determining paw preference conclusively would require consistent observations across a variety of contexts. This aspect of animal behavior is not only a curiosity but also offers insights into the neurological and evolutionary underpinnings of lateralization in the animal kingdom.

Meanwhile, reinforcement relies on short-term and long-term memory skills that are strain-dependent, causing strains to differ in the degree of laterality of its individuals. Long-term memory of previously gained laterality in handedness due to training is heavily diminished in mice with absent corpus callosum and reduced hippocampal commissure.

In thoroughbreds, the strength of motor laterality increases with age. Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction. Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive French saddlebreds glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the trotters, although the emotive index is the same for both breeds.

(Branson and Rogers, 2006) Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.<br>Domestic cats (Felis catus) show an individual handedness when reaching for static food. In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time. There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry. One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament. Furthermore, individuals with stronger paw preferences are rated as more confident, affectionate, active, and friendly.<br>Chimpanzees show right-handedness in certain conditions.

Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that "mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species.

Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg androgens concentration.<br>In fish[edit]<br>Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (Melanotaenia spp.) schools.

In ants, Temnothorax albipennis (rock ant) scouts show behavioural lateralization when exploring unknown nest sites, showing a population-level bias to prefer left turns. One possible reason for this is that its environment is partly maze-like and consistently turning in one direction is a good way to search and exit mazes without getting lost. This turning bias is correlated with slight asymmetries in the ants' compound eyes (differential ommatidia count).

The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the language hemisphere.<br>Human

'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike placental mammals, they lack a corpus callosum. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus) and the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength. There was less evidence for handedness in arboreal species. Studies of dogs, horses, and domestic cats have shown that females of those species tend to be right-handed, while males tend to be left-handed.
