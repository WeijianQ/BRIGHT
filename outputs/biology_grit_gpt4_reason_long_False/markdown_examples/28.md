## Original Question

*Hot water and bacteria
I know that it is common to say, "use hot water when washing your hands" or when you've got a cut, "wash your hands with warm water," etc. I was wondering, why is this the case? Since bacteria grow in warm environments, you would think that it might be beneficial for bacteria. Is this just another myth or is this actually true?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why hot or warm water is recommended for washing hands or cleaning cuts, despite the knowledge that bacteria often thrive in warm environments. This concern raises questions about the effectiveness of hot water in hygiene practices and whether it might inadvertently benefit bacterial growth.

To address this, let's break down the issue step by step:

1. **Bacteria Growth Conditions**: It's true that many bacteria thrive in warm, moist environments. However, the optimal temperature range for bacterial growth is typically between 20°C to 37°C (68°F to 98.6°F), which is roughly around body temperature. Temperatures higher than this range can start to inhibit bacterial growth or even kill bacteria.

2. **Purpose of Washing with Warm Water**:
   - **Comfort and Effectiveness**: Washing with warm water is generally more comfortable than using cold water. This comfort can encourage people to wash their hands more thoroughly and for a longer duration, thereby improving the effectiveness of the washing. 
   - **Soap Performance**: Warm water can help soap lather more effectively, which improves its ability to remove dirt, grease, and microbes from the skin. This doesn't necessarily kill the bacteria but is more about mechanically removing them from your hands.
   - **Oil and Dirt Removal**: Warm water is more effective at dissolving oils and other substances that can harbor bacteria on the skin. By removing these substances, you're directly removing bacteria and reducing their ability to grow.

3. **Hot Water and Skin Damage**: It's important to note that while warm water is beneficial, excessively hot water can damage the skin, leading to dryness or irritation. Damaged skin can be more susceptible to infection. Therefore, the temperature recommended for washing hands or cleaning cuts should be warm but not so hot as to cause discomfort or harm.

4. **Disinfection and Sterilization**: When it comes to disinfecting or sterilizing, temperatures need to be much higher than what would be considered safe or comfortable for washing hands or wounds. Boiling water, for example, is used to kill bacteria, but it's not practical or safe for direct skin contact.

In conclusion, washing with warm water is a practice rooted in enhancing the mechanical effectiveness of handwashing and the performance of soap, rather than directly killing bacteria through heat. Warm water improves comfort, which encourages better washing practices, and aids in the removal of oils and dirt that can harbor bacteria. It's a balance between using a temperature that is effective for cleaning without promoting bacterial growth or causing skin damage. This approach, combined with the use of soap (and antiseptics for wounds), is effective for reducing the risk of infection and promoting hygiene.

When another 15 seconds is added, bacterial counts drop by close to 99.9% (bacterial counts are measured in logarithmic reductions). Few of us wash our hands that long — 5 seconds is more like it. One reason you're supposed to use cool or lukewarm water is to increase the chances you'll wash them a little longer. Hot water is also more damaging to skin.
