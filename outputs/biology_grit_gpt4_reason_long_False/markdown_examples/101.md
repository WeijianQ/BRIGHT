# Query `101`

## Original Question

*Which part of human eyes is getting tired?
It's a thing of common sense that if you read, drive or look at computer screen for too long your eyes will get tired. They burn, itch and try to close all the time.
But I was wondering which part(s) of them need rest so much... Blinking muscles? Lense muscles? Or the eyeball is drying out?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding which specific part(s) of the human eyes get tired from prolonged activities such as reading, driving, or looking at a computer screen, and why this happens. To address this question, we need to explore the anatomy of the eye, the nature of eye strain, and how various eye functions are impacted by intense or prolonged use.

1. **Eye Anatomy and Function Related to the Problem**: The human eye is complex, consisting of several parts that work together to provide vision. Key components include the cornea, lens, iris, retina, and the muscles that control eye movement and focus. When considering eye fatigue, we can narrow down to a few areas that are most relevant:
   - **Ciliary Muscles (Lens Adjustment)**: These muscles adjust the lens shape to focus on objects at different distances, a process known as accommodation. Prolonged focus on objects at a fixed distance, especially close-up work, can tire these muscles.
   - **Extraocular Muscles (Eye Movement)**: These six muscles control eye movement. Constant tracking or rapid movement, as in reading or following objects, can strain these muscles.
   - **Meibomian Glands (Tear Film Maintenance)**: Located in the eyelids, these glands secrete oils to prevent the evaporation of the eye's tear film. Staring at screens often leads to reduced blinking, which can cause the tear film to evaporate more quickly, leading to dry eyes.

2. **Reasoning and Relevant Information**:
   - **Accommodation Fatigue**: The ciliary muscles' continuous effort to maintain focus on near objects, such as screens or books, can lead to what is commonly known as eye strain or fatigue. This is especially relevant in activities requiring prolonged focus at a fixed distance.
   - **Muscle Fatigue**: Like any muscle, the extraocular muscles can become tired from overuse, leading to a sensation of strain.
   - **Dry Eyes**: Staring reduces blink rate, which normally helps to refresh the tear film. A diminished tear film can lead to dryness, irritation, and a burning sensation.
   - **Visual Information Processing**: Beyond the physical aspects, there's also the cognitive load of processing visual information. Prolonged periods of intense focus can be mentally exhausting, contributing to the overall sensation of eye fatigue.

3. **Drafting an Answer**:
When eyes get tired from activities like reading, driving, or staring at screens, several factors are at play. Primarily, the ciliary muscles that adjust the lens for focusing can become fatigued from constant use, especially when looking at something up close for extended periods. This is a significant source of what we perceive as eye strain.

Moreover, the muscles controlling eye movements are working continuously during these activities to track text or objects, which can also lead to fatigue. This is akin to any muscle in the body getting tired after prolonged or intense use.

Another critical factor is the reduction in blinking, which is common when focusing intently on screens or books. This reduction can lead to the tear film on the eyeball's surface evaporating more quickly than it is replenished, causing dryness, irritation, and a burning sensation. This is because the Meibomian glands are not stimulated enough to maintain a healthy tear film, leading to what is commonly referred to as dry eye syndrome.

In summary, the tiredness felt from prolonged eye use is multifaceted, involving muscle fatigue (both ciliary and extraocular muscles), dry eyes due to reduced blinking, and the cognitive load of processing visual information. Resting the eyes, ensuring good lighting, taking regular breaks to look at distant objects (the 20-20-20 rule), and maintaining a healthy blink rate are essential strategies for mitigating eye fatigue.

> Symptoms[edit]<br>Some symptoms of CVS include headaches, blurred vision, neck pain, fatigue, eye strain, dry eyes, irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo/dizziness, polyopia, and difficulty refocusing the eyes.  These symptoms can be further aggravated by improper lighting conditions (i.e. glare, strong blue-spectrum backlights, or bright overhead lighting) or air moving past the eyes (e.g. overhead vents, direct air from a fan).

### GROUND TRUTH 1, ranked 15, eyes_tired/Computer_vision_syndrome_0.txt
> Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a condition resulting from focusing the eyes on a computer or other display device for protracted, uninterrupted periods of time and the eye's muscles being unable to recover from the constant tension required to maintain focus on a close object.
