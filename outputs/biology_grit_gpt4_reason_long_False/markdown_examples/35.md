# Query `35`

## Original Question

*Why does hair turn grey or white, and why does it happen later for some?
The question is pretty simple: what is happening molecularly when hair turns grey or white? I would imagine that it is due to the lack of a particular compound. I'm also interested in why some people's onset of grey hair happens much later than others.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're inquiring about involves understanding the molecular basis of why hair turns grey or white and why this process occurs at different times for different individuals. To address your questions in detail, let's break down the process step by step, looking at the relevant biological and genetic factors involved.

### Understanding Hair Pigmentation

1. **Hair Color Determination**: Hair color is primarily determined by the presence and concentration of melanin, a pigment produced by cells known as melanocytes. There are two types of melanin involved: eumelanin (which gives hair black or brown color) and pheomelanin (which gives hair blonde or red colors).

2. **Melanin Production and Transfer**: Melanocytes produce melanin and transfer it to the keratinocytes, the cells that make up the majority of the hair shaft. As hair grows, these pigments are incorporated into the hair, giving it its color.

### Molecular Changes Leading to Grey or White Hair

1. **Decrease in Melanin Production**: The most direct cause of hair turning grey or white is a decrease in melanin production. Over time, melanocytes can become less active or die off, reducing the amount of melanin that is transferred to new hair cells.

2. **Hydrogen Peroxide Accumulation**: Research has also shown that hair follicles naturally produce small amounts of hydrogen peroxide, a bleaching agent. Usually, this is broken down by the enzyme catalase. However, as we age, catalase production can decrease, leading to an accumulation of hydrogen peroxide which can bleach the hair from the inside out, reducing or eliminating its color.

3. **Genetic Factors**: The timing of when these processes begin to significantly affect hair color is largely determined by genetics. Some people have genes that maintain melanocyte activity and catalase production longer into their lives, while others may experience a decrease in these functions earlier.

### Why Grey Hair Happens Later for Some

1. **Genetic Variability**: The most significant factor is genetic predisposition. Just as genes determine hair color, they also influence when and how quickly the process of greying begins.

2. **Environmental and Lifestyle Factors**: Factors such as stress, diet, and smoking have been suggested to potentially influence the greying process, though genetics play a more substantial role.

3. **Health Conditions**: Certain health conditions and medications can also affect hair pigmentation, either accelerating the greying process or, in some cases, causing hair to return to its original color if the underlying condition is treated.

In conclusion, the transition of hair to grey or white is primarily due to a decrease in melanin production, influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and possibly health-related factors. The variability in the onset of greying among different individuals is largely genetic, with lifestyle and health conditions playing secondary roles. Understanding the specific genetic mechanisms and how they interact with environmental factors remains an area of ongoing research, offering potential insights into why some people experience greying later than others.

> Finally, changes in cellular survival signals could contribute<br>to the loss of melanocyte stem cells seen during hair<br>graying. Mice deficient for the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2<br>demonstrate sudden onset of hair graying after the first hair<br>cycle [48]. Recent characterization of melanocyte stem cells<br>in Bcl2-deficient mice demonstrated that Bcl2 plays a<br>critical role in the survival of melanocyte stem cells during<br>the first hair follicle anagen cycle since the loss of<br>melanocyte stem cells at p8.5 precedes the disappearance<br>of the melanocyte lineage and hair graying [32]. Another<br>study suggested that dependence on Bcl2 for survival may<br>be restricted to melanoblasts in the c-kit-dependent stage<br>[28]. Regardless, both studies demonstrate that changes in<br>cellular survival signals such as Bcl2 can alter melanocyte<br>survival and may contribute to the loss of melanocyte stem<br>cells seen with aging.<br>Comparison to Aging in other Organs: is Hair Graying<br>Unique among Aging Phenotypes?<br>The progenitor cell organization seen in the melanocyte<br>lineage is architecturally similar to that seen in other compartments, consisting of three major types of cells: quiescent, self-renewing stem cells, highly proliferative transient<br>amplifying cells, and differentiated cells [6]. The changes<br>seen in the melanocyte lineage—markedly reduced numbers of differentiated melanocytes and diminished numbers<br>of melanocyte stem cells—are consistent with a primary<br>melanocyte stem cell problem leading to loss of the entire<br>lineage. However, it is not clear to what extent the changes in<br>melanocytes are representative of those in other aging<br>tissues. In contrast to melanocyte stem cells, hematopoeitic<br>stem cells and skeletal muscle stem cells do not significantly<br>decline in number with aging [36]. Yet these organ systems<br>demonstrate either a reduced ability to regenerate or abnormal differentiation with advancing age, suggesting that<br>changes in stem cell function may explain the altered<br>regenerative capacity of aging [47]. Evidence for systemic<br>factors that contribute to age-related decline come from<br>studies in which exposure to systemic factors restored<br>regenerative potential of skeletal muscle [13]. Given the<br>mounting evidence that altered stem cell function or reduced<br>stem cell number may contribute to aging, an improved<br>understanding of how to regulate tissue stem cells may have<br>significant effects on our ability to prevent the eventual<br>decline in aging tissues.<br>Stem Cell Rev (2007) 3:212–217 215<br>Significant progress has been made in understanding<br>what causes age-related hair graying. These data so far<br>suggest that hair graying occurs primarily due to a gradual<br>loss of the melanocyte lineage rather than due to impaired<br>melanocyte function. However, the factors that lead to loss<br>of the melanocyte lineage remain poorly understood. It<br>remains possible that age-related changes in melanocyte<br>sensitivity to oxidative species produced during melanogenesis could contribute to an increase in melanocyte<br>apoptosis. In support of this idea, one study found increased<br>apoptosis in the differentiated melanocytes of aging hair<br>follicles [2]. However, while this may contribute to loss of<br>differentiated melanocytes, it does not explain the corresponding decrease in bulge melanocytes seen in aging hair<br>follicles, suggesting that other factors must also contribute<br>to loss of melanocyte stem cells. Age-related epigenetic<br>modifications could trigger the growth arrest of melanocyte<br>stem cells leading to their eventual depletion or alter to<br>niche rendering it incapable of supporting self-renewal [3].<br>Another possibility is that melanocyte stem cells themselves may have an intrinsically determined lifespan and<br>can only proliferate for a limited number of cell divisions<br>[39]. Finally, there may be changes in proliferation,<br>survival, or differentiation signals in the melanocyte stem<br>cell population that occur with human aging. A more<br>detailed molecular and genetic analysis of hair graying will<br>clearly facilitate a deeper understanding of aging in other<br>tissues and cell lineages.

These data indicate that telomere length could play<br>a limiting role in the ability of cells in the melanocyte<br>lineage cells to regenerate.

> After the initial formation of the hair placode, melanoblasts<br>upregulate dopachrome tautomerase (Dct, also called TRP2)<br>an early marker of the melanocytic lineage and localize to<br>the lower part of the permanent hair follicle, where they<br>differentiate into melanocyte stem cells and become independent of c-kit signaling, as evidenced by the continued<br>presence of these cells even after c-kit inhibition [8, 33, 50].<br>In mature hair follicles, the melanocyte lineage consists<br>of three anatomically and functionally distinct compartments: melanocyte stem cells, melanocyte progenitor cells<br>and terminally differentiated melanocytes [8, 44]. Melanocyte stem cells are quiescent cells that reside in the lower<br>part of the permanent hair follicle, in a specialized niche<br>termed the bulge. With the initiation of a new anagen, the<br>active phase of the hair follicle cycle, melanocyte stem cells<br>proliferate, and give rise to melanocyte progenitor cells (see<br>Fig. 1). These transient amplifying cells are proliferative<br>progenitor cells present in the outer root sheath [33]. Both<br>melanocyte stem cells and progenitor cells express Dct and<br>TRP1 but lack tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for<br>melanin synthesis, and therefore are unable to produce<br>pigment. Melanocyte progenitors differentiate to yield<br>mature melanocytes, which are located in the hair follicle<br>bulb and which express all major melanogenic enzymes<br>(TRP-1, Dct and tyrosinase). The production of melanin by<br>differentiated melanocytes and the direct transfer of<br>pigment in melanosomes to adjacent keratinocytes is the<br>means by which growing hair becomes pigmented.

Overexpression of SCF<br>in the skin of K14-SCF transgenic mice creates a new niche<br>for melanocytes in the basal layer of the interfollicular skin<br>[22]. Remarkably, bulge melanocyte stem cells were shown<br>to repopulate the artificial epidermal niches in K14-SCF<br>transgenic mice after these epidermal melanocytes were<br>depleted by neonatal treatment with anti-c-kit antibodies.<br>The demonstration that Dct+ bulge melanocytes were<br>quiescent, entered cell cycle with induction of a new anagen,<br>could self-renew and repopulate depleted niches identified<br>these cells as melanocyte stem cells [33].<br>Microarray-based analysis of gene expression in purified<br>melanocyte stem cells has shown that bulge melanocyte<br>stem cells lack many of the markers seen in more differentiated melanocyte progenitors or differentiated melanocytes such as c-kit, Tyr, Trp1, Ki-67, Lef1, and Sox10,<br>suggesting that the niche environment may protect these<br>melanocyte stem cells from extrinsic differentiation signals<br>[34]. In support of this idea, the hair follicle bulge has been<br>shown to have an inhibitory effect on epidermal hair follicle<br>stem cells, which also reside in this region [7, 46]. The<br>inhibitory role of these specialized stem cell niches are<br>perhaps best characterized in the drosophila germ cell<br>system [21, 41]. Interestingly, the only melanocytes capable<br>of producing pigment are located near the dermal papilla<br>suggesting that extrinsic signaling from the dermal papilla<br>may be involved in the final differentiation of melanocytes.<br>Human Hair Graying<br>In humans, as in mice, melanocytes migrate from the neural<br>crest into the hair follicle during hair morphogenesis under<br>control of signaling through c-kit and endothelins [4].<br>Unlike mice, melanocytes in humans are not primarily<br>restricted to the hair follicle, but also reside in the dermis<br>and epidermis. While epidermal melanogenesis appears to<br>be independent of hair follicle cycling, melanocytes in<br>human hair follicles remain tightly regulated during hair<br>follicle cycling [40]. Although there is a gradual decrease in<br>epidermal pigmentation during aging [35], this is less<br>prominent than the significant loss of hair pigmentation<br>that occurs with aging [45].<br>Recent experiments have demonstrated a corresponding<br>loss of melanocytes and melanocyte stem cells associated<br>with the loss of hair pigmentation seen with human aging<br>[42]. Staining for pMel17, an early marker in the melanocyte lineage, demonstrated a decreasing number of unpigmented melanocytes in the bulge region of the hair follicle<br>in samples from patients between ages 40 and 60 and an<br>absence of these cells in samples taken from patients ages<br>70 to 80 [12]. Recent studies with MITF immunostaining<br>on human samples also support these findings [32]. The<br>remaining melanocytes continue to express the proteins<br>required for melanogenesis and are able to synthesize<br>melanin suggesting that graying is caused by primarily by<br>a depletion of the melanocyte lineage rather than melanocyte<br>dysfunction.

The migration and survival of these melanoblasts<br>are dependent on c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor (SCF),<br>as neonatal deletion of either SCF or c-kit results in an<br>irreversible loss of coat pigmentation [9, 27, 30, 31, 49].

> Aging, Graying and Loss of Melanocyte Stem Cells<br>Kavita Y. Sarin & Steven E. Artandi<br>Published online: 18 August 2007<br># Humana Press Inc. 2007<br>Abstract Hair graying is one of the prototypical signs of<br>human aging. Maintenance of hair pigmentation is dependent on the presence and functionality of melanocytes,<br>neural crest derived cells which synthesize pigment for<br>growing hair. The melanocytes, themselves, are maintained<br>by a small number of stem cells which reside in the bulge<br>region of the hair follicle. The recent characterization of the<br>melanocyte lineage during aging has significantly accelerated our understanding of how age-related changes in the<br>melanocyte stem cell compartment contribute to hair<br>graying. This review will discuss our current understanding<br>of hair graying, drawing on evidence from human and<br>mouse studies, and consider the contribution of melanocyte<br>stem cells to this process. Furthermore, using the melanocyte lineage as an example, it will discuss common theories<br>of tissue and stem cell aging.<br>Keywords Stem cells . Aging . Pigmentation . Graying .<br>Melanocytes.

Light mutation<br>Stem Cells and Aging<br>Normal tissue homeostasis requires continual cellular<br>replenishment as existing cells are lost due to injury or<br>physiologic turnover. In order to support this critical demand<br>for renewal, many mammalian tissues harbor adult stem<br>cells—specialized multipotent cells with the capacity to both<br>self-renew and give rise to differentiated progeny in response<br>to appropriate extrinsic signals. Stem cells have been<br>identified in a number of tissues including the skin, bone<br>marrow, intestine, brain, and skeletal muscle and serve as a<br>reservoir for the production of new cells in these organ<br>systems. In this way, stem cells play a key role in regenerating<br>and maintaining adult tissues over time.<br>Physiological aging is characterized by a gradual decline<br>in the ability of tissues to maintain homeostasis and regenerate new tissue after injury. For example, the capacity of<br>the hematopoetic system to mobilize under stress becomes<br>increasingly impaired with chronological aging and differentiation of hematopoeitic progenitors becomes altered to<br>favor myeloid rather than lymphoid fates [16, 37]. A<br>reduction in regenerative potential has also been demonstrated in skeletal muscle [14] and skin [17]. Although this<br>phenomenon has been well described in multiple tissues,<br>the factors contributing to this impaired regenerative<br>capacity remain largely unknown. In particular, the extent<br>to which changes in stem cell number or function contribute to this impairment remains poorly understood.

> Finally, changes in cellular survival signals could contribute<br>to the loss of melanocyte stem cells seen during hair<br>graying. Mice deficient for the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2<br>demonstrate sudden onset of hair graying after the first hair<br>cycle [48]. Recent characterization of melanocyte stem cells<br>in Bcl2-deficient mice demonstrated that Bcl2 plays a<br>critical role in the survival of melanocyte stem cells during<br>the first hair follicle anagen cycle since the loss of<br>melanocyte stem cells at p8.5 precedes the disappearance<br>of the melanocyte lineage and hair graying [32]. Another<br>study suggested that dependence on Bcl2 for survival may<br>be restricted to melanoblasts in the c-kit-dependent stage<br>[28]. Regardless, both studies demonstrate that changes in<br>cellular survival signals such as Bcl2 can alter melanocyte<br>survival and may contribute to the loss of melanocyte stem<br>cells seen with aging.<br>Comparison to Aging in other Organs: is Hair Graying<br>Unique among Aging Phenotypes?<br>The progenitor cell organization seen in the melanocyte<br>lineage is architecturally similar to that seen in other compartments, consisting of three major types of cells: quiescent, self-renewing stem cells, highly proliferative transient<br>amplifying cells, and differentiated cells [6]. The changes<br>seen in the melanocyte lineage—markedly reduced numbers of differentiated melanocytes and diminished numbers<br>of melanocyte stem cells—are consistent with a primary<br>melanocyte stem cell problem leading to loss of the entire<br>lineage. However, it is not clear to what extent the changes in<br>melanocytes are representative of those in other aging<br>tissues. In contrast to melanocyte stem cells, hematopoeitic<br>stem cells and skeletal muscle stem cells do not significantly<br>decline in number with aging [36]. Yet these organ systems<br>demonstrate either a reduced ability to regenerate or abnormal differentiation with advancing age, suggesting that<br>changes in stem cell function may explain the altered<br>regenerative capacity of aging [47]. Evidence for systemic<br>factors that contribute to age-related decline come from<br>studies in which exposure to systemic factors restored<br>regenerative potential of skeletal muscle [13]. Given the<br>mounting evidence that altered stem cell function or reduced<br>stem cell number may contribute to aging, an improved<br>understanding of how to regulate tissue stem cells may have<br>significant effects on our ability to prevent the eventual<br>decline in aging tissues.<br>Stem Cell Rev (2007) 3:212–217 215<br>Significant progress has been made in understanding<br>what causes age-related hair graying. These data so far<br>suggest that hair graying occurs primarily due to a gradual<br>loss of the melanocyte lineage rather than due to impaired<br>melanocyte function. However, the factors that lead to loss<br>of the melanocyte lineage remain poorly understood. It<br>remains possible that age-related changes in melanocyte<br>sensitivity to oxidative species produced during melanogenesis could contribute to an increase in melanocyte<br>apoptosis. In support of this idea, one study found increased<br>apoptosis in the differentiated melanocytes of aging hair<br>follicles [2]. However, while this may contribute to loss of<br>differentiated melanocytes, it does not explain the corresponding decrease in bulge melanocytes seen in aging hair<br>follicles, suggesting that other factors must also contribute<br>to loss of melanocyte stem cells. Age-related epigenetic<br>modifications could trigger the growth arrest of melanocyte<br>stem cells leading to their eventual depletion or alter to<br>niche rendering it incapable of supporting self-renewal [3].<br>Another possibility is that melanocyte stem cells themselves may have an intrinsically determined lifespan and<br>can only proliferate for a limited number of cell divisions<br>[39]. Finally, there may be changes in proliferation,<br>survival, or differentiation signals in the melanocyte stem<br>cell population that occur with human aging. A more<br>detailed molecular and genetic analysis of hair graying will<br>clearly facilitate a deeper understanding of aging in other<br>tissues and cell lineages.
