# Query `57`

## Original Question

*Why do dog's eyes glow green on a photo?
Taking my current profile picture as a prominent example:
Dog's eyes glowing green in camera
This photo has been taken with flash. As I gather, this is the same effect that makes a human's eyes glow red on photos, namely the reflection of the flash at the choroid and then passing back through the retina.
The retina is full of bloodvessels and the blood inside them gives the reflected light it's reddish color.
If it's the same effect, why is the color different?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here revolves around understanding why a dog's eyes tend to glow green when photographed with a flash, as opposed to the red-eye effect commonly seen in humans. This phenomenon is indeed related to the reflection of light from the flash within the eye but varies in color between species due to differences in eye anatomy and physiology.

1. **Understanding Eye Anatomy and the Tapetum Lucidum**: The key to addressing this question lies in the anatomy of the eye, specifically a part called the tapetum lucidum. The tapetum lucidum is a layer of tissue located behind the retina. Its primary function is to reflect visible light back through the retina, increasing the light available to the photoreceptors. This enhances night vision in animals that possess it, including many dogs. Humans, on the other hand, do not have a tapetum lucidum.

2. **Reflective Properties and Color Differences**: The color difference in the glow—green in dogs versus red in humans—is primarily due to the presence of the tapetum lucidum in dogs and its absence in humans. In humans, when a photo is taken with a flash, the light from the flash penetrates the eye and is reflected off the blood-rich choroid behind the retina, producing a red glow. This is the well-known red-eye effect.

   In dogs, the tapetum lucidum acts as a mirror, reflecting the flash's light back through the retina. The materials and structure of the tapetum lucidum can vary between different species, which can affect the color of the light reflected. In many dogs, this reflection produces a greenish glow, though the exact shade can vary depending on the individual dog's eye characteristics.

3. **Variability in Eye Glow Color**: It's worth noting that the color of the glow in animal eyes can vary not just between species but within them. Factors that can influence the color include the age of the animal, the specific breed, and individual differences in the tapetum lucidum's composition.

4. **Photographic Conditions**: The conditions under which the photo is taken can also influence the appearance of eye glow. The angle of the flash, the intensity of the light, and the distance from the camera can all affect how the light is reflected and perceived in the photograph.

In summary, the green glow observed in a dog's eyes in photographs taken with flash is due to the presence of the tapetum lucidum, which reflects the light back through the retina. This contrasts with the red-eye effect in humans, which results from the reflection of light off the choroid. The specific color of the glow can vary depending on several factors, including the animal's species, age, and individual eye characteristics, as well as the photographic conditions.

> Classification[edit]<br>A classification of anatomical variants of tapeta lucida defines four types:<br>Retinal tapetum, as seen in teleosts (with a variety of reflecting materials from lipids to phenols), crocodiles (with guanine), marsupials (with lipid spheres), and fruit bats (with phospholipids). The tapetum lucidum is within the retinal pigment epithelium; in the other three types the tapetum is within the choroid behind the retina. Two anatomical classes can be distinguished: occlusible and non-occlusible.<br>The brownsnout spookfish has an extraordinary focusing mirror derived from a retinal tapetum.<br>Choroidal guainine tapetum, as seen in cartilaginous fish The tapetum is a palisade of cells containing stacks of flat hexagonal crystals of guanine.<br>Choroidal tapetum cellulosum, as seen in carnivores, rodents and cetacea. The tapetum consists of layers of cells containing organized, highly refractive crystals. These crystals are diverse in shape and makeup: dogs and ferrets use zinc, cats use riboflavin and zinc, and lemurs use only riboflavin.<br>Choroidal tapetum fibrosum, as seen in cows, sheep, goats and horses. The tapetum is an array of extracellular fibers, most commonly collagen.<br>The functional differences between these four structural classes of tapeta lucida are not known.<br>This section is missing information about bird anatomy: are they all retinal? If so, they should be moved up to the 4-type list.. Please expand the section to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (August 2023)<br>This classification does not include tapeta lucida in birds. Kiwis, stone-curlews, the boat-billed heron, the flightless kākāpō and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a tapetum lucidum. Nightjars use a retinal tapetum lucidum composed of lipids.<br>Like humans, some animals lack a tapetum lucidum and they usually are diurnal. These include haplorhine primates, squirrels, some birds, red kangaroo, and pigs. Strepsirrhine primates are mostly nocturnal and, with the exception of several diurnal Eulemur species, have a tapetum lucidum of riboflavin crystals.<br>When a tapetum lucidum is present, its location on the eyeball varies with the placement of the eyeball in the head, such that in all cases the tapetum lucidum enhances night vision in the center of the animal's field of view.<br>Apart from its eyeshine, the tapetum lucidum itself has a color. It is often described as iridescent. In tigers it is greenish. In ruminants it may be golden green with a blue periphery, or whitish or pale blue with a lavender periphery. In dogs it may be whitish with a blue periphery. The color in reindeer changes seasonally, allowing the animals to better avoid predators in low-light winter at the price of blurrier vision.

> Function and mechanism[edit]<br>Choroid dissected from a calf's eye, tapetum lucidum appearing iridescent blue<br>The presence of a tapetum lucidum enables animals to see in dimmer light than would otherwise be possible. The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores.<br>The tapetum functions as a retroreflector which reflects light directly back along the light path. This serves to match the original and reflected light, thus maintaining the sharpness and contrast of the image on the retina. The tapetum lucidum reflects with constructive interference, thus increasing the quantity of light passing through the retina. In the cat, the tapetum lucidum increases the sensitivity of vision by 44%, allowing the cat to see light that is imperceptible to human eyes.<br>It has been speculated that some flashlight fish may use eyeshine both to detect and to communicate with other flashlight fish. American scientist Nathan H. Lents has proposed that the tapetum lucidum evolved in vertebrates, but not in cephalopods, which have a very similar eye, because of the backwards-facing nature of vertebrate photoreceptors. The tapetum boosts photosensitivity under conditions of low illumination, thus compensating for the suboptimal design of the vertebrate retina.

> The tapetum lucidum (Latin for 'bright tapestry, coverlet'; /təˈpiːtəm ˈluːsɪdəm/ tə-PEE-təm LOO-sih-dəm; pl.: tapeta lucida) is a layer of tissue in the eye of many vertebrates and some other animals. Lying immediately behind the retina, it is a retroreflector. It reflects visible light back through the retina, increasing the light available to the photoreceptors (although slightly blurring the image). The tapetum lucidum contributes to the superior night vision of some animals. Many of these animals are nocturnal, especially carnivores, while others are deep sea animals.<br>Similar adaptations occur in some species of spiders. Haplorhine primates, including humans, are diurnal and lack a tapetum lucidum.
