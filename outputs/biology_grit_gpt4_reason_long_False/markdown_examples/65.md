## Original Question

*Why do human eyes glow red on a photo and dog's eyes green?
Previous Research
I know that cameras sometimes come with an anti "red eye" functionality that involves two flashes, presumably the second flash coincides with the shutter opening.
Question
Why do camera flashes sometimes lead to photos of humans with red eyes? And why do dog's eyes appear green?

The reason for the green dog's eyes has been answered quite shortly under the question "why-do-dogs-eyes-glow-green-on-a-photo", but that question does not answer my specific question: Why do humans have red eyes on flashed photos and why are dog's eyes green?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The phenomenon of eyes glowing in photos taken with flash can be explained by understanding how light interacts with the eyes. This occurrence, typically referred to as "red-eye" in humans and often seen as green or yellow in dogs, is fundamentally due to the reflection of the camera flash from the back of the eye. Let's break down the process to address your questions more thoroughly.

### Human Red-Eye Effect

1. **Anatomy of the Human Eye**: The back of the human eye is lined with a layer called the retina, which contains light-sensitive cells responsible for vision. Behind the retina is the choroid, which is rich in blood vessels.

2. **Role of the Flash**: When a camera flash goes off, the light travels through the pupil (the opening in the center of the eye) and reaches the back of the eye. In low-light conditions, the pupils are dilated to allow more light in, which means more of the flash can enter.

3. **Reflection and Capture**: The light from the flash reflects off the choroid, and because of the high concentration of blood vessels, this reflection often appears red. This reflected light then travels back out of the eye, through the lens of the camera, and is captured in the photo.

4. **Red-Eye Reduction Technology**: Many cameras have a red-eye reduction feature, which works by emitting pre-flashes before the main flash. These pre-flashes cause the pupils to contract, reducing their size, and thereby decreasing the amount of light that can enter and reflect off the choroid. This reduces the chances of red-eye appearing in the photo.

### Green or Yellow Glow in Dogs' Eyes

1. **Anatomy of the Dog Eye**: Similar to humans, dogs have a retina at the back of their eyes. However, dogs (and many other animals) have an additional layer behind the retina called the tapetum lucidum.

2. **Function of the Tapetum Lucidum**: The tapetum lucidum acts as a reflector, bouncing light that passes through the retina back into the eye. This enhances night vision by giving the photoreceptor cells another chance to pick up the light. In the wild, this adaptation is crucial for nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk) animals.

3. **Color of the Reflection**: The color of the glow seen in animals' eyes can vary depending on several factors, including the specific composition and properties of the tapetum lucidum and the angle at which the light enters and reflects back. In dogs, this reflection often appears green, yellow, or even blue.

4. **Photographic Capture**: When a flash photo of a dog is taken, the light from the flash is reflected by the tapetum lucidum, not the choroid as in humans. This reflection is what gives their eyes a green or yellow glow in photos.

In summary, the red-eye effect in humans is caused by the reflection of light off the blood-rich choroid behind the retina, while the green or yellow glow in dogs' eyes results from light reflecting off the tapetum lucidum. Different anatomical structures behind the retina are responsible for these distinctive effects seen in flash photography.

> Function and mechanism[edit]<br>Choroid dissected from a calf's eye, tapetum lucidum appearing iridescent blue<br>The presence of a tapetum lucidum enables animals to see in dimmer light than would otherwise be possible. The tapetum lucidum, which is iridescent, reflects light roughly on the interference principles of thin-film optics, as seen in other iridescent tissues. However, the tapetum lucidum cells are leucophores, not iridophores.<br>The tapetum functions as a retroreflector which reflects light directly back along the light path. This serves to match the original and reflected light, thus maintaining the sharpness and contrast of the image on the retina. The tapetum lucidum reflects with constructive interference, thus increasing the quantity of light passing through the retina. In the cat, the tapetum lucidum increases the sensitivity of vision by 44%, allowing the cat to see light that is imperceptible to human eyes.<br>It has been speculated that some flashlight fish may use eyeshine both to detect and to communicate with other flashlight fish. American scientist Nathan H. Lents has proposed that the tapetum lucidum evolved in vertebrates, but not in cephalopods, which have a very similar eye, because of the backwards-facing nature of vertebrate photoreceptors. The tapetum boosts photosensitivity under conditions of low illumination, thus compensating for the suboptimal design of the vertebrate retina.

In the lateral ventricles, it is found in the body, and continued in an enlarged amount in the atrium. There is no choroid plexus in the anterior horn. In the third ventricle, there is a small amount in the roof that is continuous with that in the body, via the interventricular foramina, the channels that connect the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. A choroid plexus is in part of the roof of the fourth ventricle.<br>Microanatomy[edit]<br>The choroid plexus consists of a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The epithelium of the choroid plexus is continuous with the ependymal cell layer (ventricular layer) that lines the ventricular system. Progenitor ependymal cells are monociliated but they differentiate into multiciliated ependymal cells. Unlike the ependyma, the choroid plexus epithelial layer has tight junctions between the cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface). These tight junctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell layer into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); thus the choroid plexus acts as a blood–CSF barrier. The choroid plexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like processes that project into the ventricles. The villi, along with a brush border of microvilli, greatly increase the surface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from the blood through the epithelial cells. Choroid plexus epithelial cells actively transport sodium ions into the ventricles and water follows the resulting osmotic gradient.<br>The choroid plexus consists of many capillaries, separated from the ventricles by choroid epithelial cells. Fluid filters through these cells from blood to become cerebrospinal fluid. There is also much active transport of substances into, and out of, the CSF as it is made.

The tapetum lucidum contributes to the superior night vision of some animals.

The tapetum lucidum is within the retinal pigment epithelium; in the other three types the tapetum is within the choroid behind the retina. Two anatomical classes can be distinguished: occlusible and non-occlusible.<br>The brownsnout spookfish has an extraordinary focusing mirror derived from a retinal tapetum.<br>Choroidal guainine tapetum, as seen in cartilaginous fish The tapetum is a palisade of cells containing stacks of flat hexagonal crystals of guanine.<br>Choroidal tapetum cellulosum, as seen in carnivores, rodents and cetacea. The tapetum consists of layers of cells containing organized, highly refractive crystals. These crystals are diverse in shape and makeup: dogs and ferrets use zinc, cats use riboflavin and zinc, and lemurs use only riboflavin.<br>Choroidal tapetum fibrosum, as seen in cows, sheep, goats and horses. The tapetum is an array of extracellular fibers, most commonly collagen.<br>The functional differences between these four structural classes of tapeta lucida are not known.<br>This section is missing information about bird anatomy: are they all retinal?

Kiwis, stone-curlews, the boat-billed heron, the flightless kākāpō and many nightjars, owls, and other night birds such as the swallow-tailed gull also possess a tapetum lucidum. Nightjars use a retinal tapetum lucidum composed of lipids.<br>Like humans, some animals lack a tapetum lucidum and they usually are diurnal.

It is often described as iridescent. In tigers it is greenish. In ruminants it may be golden green with a blue periphery, or whitish or pale blue with a lavender periphery. In dogs it may be whitish with a blue periphery. The color in reindeer changes seasonally, allowing the animals to better avoid predators in low-light winter at the price of blurrier vision.
