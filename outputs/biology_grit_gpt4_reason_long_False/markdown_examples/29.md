## Original Question

*Why does my room suddenly look 'reddish'? My eyes seem to adapt to color
To get the context of this question clear, I would like you to walk through some parts of my house.
We'll start with one of my rooms as it appears normally - area Y
As evident, this part of my house has a creamish tinge to it, also the balcony door is open which further gives this room a yellow tint. Nothing special. I'll call it "area Y" (for yellow). Let's move on.
area G
Here we arrive in another part of my house which has greenish/blue shades acting as a sunlight blocker. This gives this entire place a greenish/blue tint as shown. (Ref. "area G")
So, now let's visit the area Y again. I am always surprised with what my eyes now see. This. {1}
enter image description here
You see, the same room, same lightning, yet the room now looks much more reddish than before! That's what intrigues me, why does it happen? Why my eyes suddenly become sensitive to red color?
I am not a biology student but I do know that our eyes have cones which specialize in color perception, and that there are different types of cone cells to perceive different types of colors (If I remember my high school biology correctly).
So, I somewhat get a feeling of what's happening inside my eyes (or the brain perhaps?). I suspect that as I go to area G, my eyes 'adapt' to the dominance of bluish/green light, either by decreasing pigment of blue cones or by increasing pigment of red cones, which makes my eyes more sensitive to the other end of visible light spectrum (red-yellow), causing an 'outburst' of red coloration in area 'Y'. Since pigments need time to degrade, by the time the red color pigment of my cones decreases, its activity is less than normal. It may be increased as the blue pigment's activity is less than normal and I see a reddish tinge for few moments.
This was a pure hypothesis from my part, but it seems correct to me. But why do my eyes even adapt to blue color? Why can't my eyes be unbiased towards colors?
{1} Obviously I photoshopped the red tint in the image how else could I have replicated my vision? Though it's not the most accurate description of what I see it's still a very close approximation.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're describing is the phenomenon of your room appearing "reddish" after you've spent time in an area with a greenish/blue tint, which is an example of chromatic adaptation. This change in color perception is intriguing and can be explained by understanding how our eyes and brain work together to perceive color.

**1. Understanding Chromatic Adaptation:**

Chromatic adaptation is a visual phenomenon wherein exposure to light of a certain color can cause a shift in the color perceived in other lights. This happens because the human eye adapts to the color temperature of the light source. When you move from area G (with a greenish/blue tint) to area Y, your eyes have adapted to the green/blue light, making the creamish/yellow room appear more reddish.

**2. How the Eyes Perceive Color:**

Our eyes have three types of cone cells that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light: short (S), medium (M), and long (L). These cones are roughly corresponding to blue, green, and red light, respectively. When you're in area G, the green/blue light stimulates the S and M cones more than the L cones. Over time, your eyes adapt to reduce the sensitivity of the cones that are overstimulated (S and M in this case), to balance the input and avoid oversaturation.

**3. The Role of Cone Adaptation:**

When you return to area Y, your L cones (sensitive to red light) are relatively more sensitive than the S and M cones because they were under-stimulated in area G. This increased sensitivity to red light makes the room appear more reddish than it would if your eyes hadn't adapted to the green/blue light. This is a form of color balance that our visual system automatically performs to maintain consistent color perception under varying lighting conditions.

**4. Why Eyes Adapt to Colors:**

The adaptation of eyes to colors is an evolutionary feature that enhances the ability to see in different lighting conditions. By adjusting sensitivity to different wavelengths of light, our eyes can perceive a more constant environment. This adaptation helps in identifying objects and their colors more accurately, regardless of the color temperature of the light source.

**5. Conclusion:**

Your hypothesis about the cones adapting to the dominance of blue/green light and thus making you more sensitive to the red-yellow end of the spectrum is essentially correct. This adaptation is a natural response of the visual system to maintain color constancy. The eyes can't be "unbiased" towards colors because this bias is a crucial part of how we perceive colors consistently in a world where the lighting conditions change frequently. This adaptation mechanism allows us to experience a stable and reliable visual world.

The opponent color theory is that there are four opponent channels: red versus cyan, green vs magenta, blue versus yellow, and black versus white. Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those of the other color. Therefore, a green image will produce a magenta afterimage. The green color adapts the green channel, so they produce a weaker signal.

> Function[edit]<br>Bird, reptilian, and monotreme cone cells<br>The difference in the signals received from the three cone types allows the brain to perceive a continuous range of colors, through the opponent process of color vision. (Rod cells have a peak sensitivity at 498Â nm, roughly halfway between the peak sensitivities of the S and M cones.)<br>All of the receptors contain the protein photopsin, with variations in its conformation causing differences in the optimum wavelengths absorbed.<br>The color yellow, for example, is perceived when the L cones are stimulated slightly more than the M cones, and the color red is perceived when the L cones are stimulated significantly more than the M cones. Similarly, blue and violet hues are perceived when the S receptor is stimulated more. S Cones are most sensitive to light at wavelengths around 420Â nm. However, the lens and cornea of the human eye are increasingly absorptive to shorter wavelengths, and this sets the short wavelength limit of human-visible light to approximately 380Â nm, which is therefore called 'ultraviolet' light. People with aphakia, a condition where the eye lacks a lens, sometimes report the ability to see into the ultraviolet range. At moderate to bright light levels where the cones function, the eye is more sensitive to yellowish-green light than other colors because this stimulates the two most common (M and L) of the three kinds of cones almost equally. At lower light levels, where only the rod cells function, the sensitivity is greatest at a blueish-green wavelength.<br>Cones also tend to possess a significantly elevated visual acuity because each cone cell has a lone connection to the optic nerve, therefore, the cones have an easier time telling that two stimuli are isolated. Separate connectivity is established in the<br>inner plexiform layer so that each connection is parallel.<br>The response of cone cells to light is also directionally nonuniform, peaking at a direction that receives light from the center of the pupil; this effect is known as the StilesâCrawford effect.<br>It is possible that S cones may play a role in the regulation of the circadian system and the secretion of melatonin but this role is not clear yet. The exact contribution of S cone activation to circadian regulation is unclear but any potential role would be secondary to the better established role of melanopsin (see also Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell).<br>Color afterimage[edit]<br>Sensitivity to a prolonged stimulation tends to decline over time, leading to neural adaptation. An interesting effect occurs when staring at a particular color for a minute or so. Such action leads to an exhaustion of the cone cells that respond to that color â resulting in the afterimage. This vivid color aftereffect can last for a minute or more.

> An afterimage is an image that continues to appear in the eyes after a period of exposure to the original image. An afterimage may be a normal phenomenon (physiological afterimage) or may be pathological (palinopsia). Illusory palinopsia may be a pathological exaggeration of physiological afterimages. Afterimages occur because photochemical activity in the retina continues even when the eyes are no longer experiencing the original stimulus.<br>The remainder of this article refers to physiological afterimages. A common physiological afterimage is the dim area that seems to float before one's eyes after briefly looking into a light source, such as a camera flash. Palinopsia is a common symptom of visual snow.
