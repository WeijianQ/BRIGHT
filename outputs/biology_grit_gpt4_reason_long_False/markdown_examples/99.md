## Original Question

*What creates the feeling of 'excess' blood pressure to an area of the body?
If I hang upside down, and feel blood rushing to my head, what structures are actually responsible for me "feeling" this excess flow of blood? Baroreceptors? Mechanoreceptors? Something else?
Regardless, how does this process actually work? How do I "feel" excess blood pressure to a certain area of my body?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're inquiring about involves understanding what mechanisms or structures in the body are responsible for the sensation of "excess" blood pressure or increased blood flow to a certain area, such as when hanging upside down and feeling blood rush to the head. To address this, we'll explore how the body perceives changes in blood pressure or flow, focusing on structures like baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors, and how these sensations are communicated to the brain.

### Step 1: Understanding Blood Pressure and Flow

Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels. Normally, this pressure is regulated and maintained within a certain range to ensure adequate blood flow to organs and tissues. When you change position, such as hanging upside down, gravity affects how blood pools in the body, potentially leading to an increase in blood pressure in the upper body and head.

### Step 2: Sensing Changes in Blood Pressure and Flow

The body has specialized sensory receptors to monitor changes in blood pressure and the mechanical forces exerted by the flow of blood:

1. **Baroreceptors**: These are pressure-sensitive nerve endings located primarily in the carotid sinuses (near the bifurcation of the carotid arteries in the neck) and the aortic arch. Baroreceptors respond to changes in the stretch of the vessel wall, which correlates with blood pressure. When blood pressure increases, the vessel walls stretch more, stimulating the baroreceptors. They send signals to the brain, particularly the medulla oblongata, to initiate reflex adjustments to blood pressure, such as altering heart rate and blood vessel diameter.

2. **Mechanoreceptors**: While mechanoreceptors are generally sensitive to mechanical changes or deformation within the body, specific types, like those in the skin and muscles, might not directly contribute to sensing internal blood pressure changes. However, their role in detecting pressure and touch on the body's surface can contribute to a generalized sensation of pressure or discomfort when there's increased blood flow or pressure to an area.

### Step 3: The Process of Feeling Excess Blood Pressure

When you hang upside down, the increased blood flow to the head might stimulate both baroreceptors and potentially other sensory receptors due to the stretching of vessels and possibly slight swelling or pressure changes in tissues. This can lead to:

- Activation of baroreceptors, which send signals to the brain about the increased pressure. While their primary role is to regulate blood pressure via the autonomic nervous system, the brain might interpret these signals in a way that contributes to the sensation of pressure or fullness.
- Indirectly, increased pressure and blood flow might also stimulate nearby sensory nerves, contributing to the overall sensation.

### Conclusion

The feeling of "excess" blood pressure or increased blood flow to a certain area, like when hanging upside down, involves complex interactions between baroreceptors, possibly other sensory receptors, and the central nervous system. Baroreceptors play a crucial role in detecting and responding to changes in blood pressure, and while they primarily function to maintain homeostasis, their activation contributes to the sensation of increased pressure in an area. Mechanoreceptors, particularly those sensitive to touch and pressure on the body's surface, might also play a role in how these sensations are perceived, albeit more indirectly. Together, these systems allow the body to monitor and react to changes in blood flow and pressure, ensuring vital organs receive adequate blood supply while also contributing to our sensory experience of those changes.

> Baroreceptors (or archaically, pressoreceptors) are sensors located in the carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of common carotid artery into external and internal carotids) and in the aortic arch. They sense the blood pressure and relay the information to the brain, so that a proper blood pressure can be maintained.<br>Baroreceptors are a type of mechanoreceptor sensory neuron that are excited by a stretch of the blood vessel. Thus, increases in the pressure of blood vessel triggers increased action potential generation rates and provides information to the central nervous system. This sensory information is used primarily in autonomic reflexes that in turn influence the heart cardiac output and vascular smooth muscle to influence vascular resistance. Baroreceptors act immediately as part of a negative feedback system called the baroreflex, as soon as there is a change from the usual mean arterial blood pressure, returning the pressure toward a normal level. These reflexes help regulate short-term blood pressure. The solitary nucleus in the medulla oblongata of the brain recognizes changes in the firing rate of action potentials from the baroreceptors, and influences cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.<br>Baroreceptors can be divided into two categories based on the type of blood vessel in which they are located: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure baroreceptors (also known as cardiopulmonary or volume receptors).

> Arterial baroreceptors[edit]<br>Arterial baroreceptors are stretch receptors that are stimulated by distortion of the arterial wall when pressure changes. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in both the average blood pressure or the rate of change in pressure with each arterial pulse. Action potentials triggered in the baroreceptor ending are then directly conducted to the brainstem where central terminations (synapses) transmit this information to neurons within the solitary nucleus which lies in the medulla. Reflex responses from such baroreceptor activity can trigger increases or decreases in the heart rate. Arterial baroreceptor sensory endings are simple, splayed nerve endings that lie in the tunica adventitia of the artery. An increase in the mean arterial pressure increases depolarization of these sensory endings, which results in action potentials. These action potentials are conducted to the solitary nucleus in the central nervous system by axons and have a reflex effect on the cardiovascular system through autonomic neurons. Hormone secretions that target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulation of baroreceptors.<br>At normal resting blood pressures, baroreceptors discharge with each heart beat. If blood pressure falls, such as on orthostatic hypotension or in hypovolaemic shock, baroreceptor firing rate decreases and baroreceptor reflexes act to help restore blood pressure by increasing heart rate. Signals from the carotid baroreceptors are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). Signals from the aortic baroreceptors travel through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). Carotid sinus baroreceptors are responsive to both increases or decreases in arterial pressure, while aortic arch baroreceptors are only responsive to increases in arterial pressure. Arterial baroreceptors inform reflexes about arterial blood pressure but other stretch receptors in the large veins and right atrium convey information about the low pressure parts of the circulatory system.<br>Baroreceptors respond very quickly to maintain a stable blood pressure, but their responses diminish with time and thus are most effective for conveying short term changes in blood pressure. In people with essential hypertension the baroreceptors and their reflexes change and function to maintain the elevated blood pressure as if normal. The receptors then become less sensitive to change.<br>Electrical stimulation of baroreceptors has been found to activate the baroreflex, reducing sympathetic tone throughout the body and thereby reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.
