## Original Question

*How do trees communicate in the "Wood Wide Web"?
I read on The New Yorker - The Secrets of the Wood Wide Web that trees communicate with each other through electrical impulses sent through their roots. Through these impulses they can ask other trees for some nutrient if they are getting it in insufficient amount or warn the other trees about an upcoming pest attack. This phenomenon is termed as the Wood Wide Web.
So how do trees distinguish in different types of impulses that they receive if they don't even have a brain? And does this process show any resemblance to nervous system in animals?

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding how trees communicate with each other through the "Wood Wide Web," specifically how they distinguish between different types of impulses without a brain, and whether this process has any resemblance to the nervous system in animals. To address these questions, we'll break down the concepts involved and explore the mechanisms behind this fascinating phenomenon.

### 1. The "Wood Wide Web" and How Trees Communicate

The term "Wood Wide Web" refers to the complex network of roots and fungal connections (mycorrhizal networks) that allows trees and other plant species to communicate and share resources. This network is primarily facilitated by mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants. The fungi colonize the plant roots and extend far into the soil, connecting multiple plants together.

### 2. Transmission of Electrical Impulses and Chemical Signals

While the concept of trees sending "electrical impulses" through their roots is a simplification, it's more accurate to say that trees and plants can send chemical signals through the mycorrhizal networks. These signals can indicate various needs or distresses, such as the requirement for nutrients or the presence of pests.

Plants do generate bioelectrical signals, and while these are not identical to the nerve impulses in animals, they are a form of internal communication. These signals can trigger various physiological responses, including the release of chemicals.

### 3. Distinguishing Between Different Signals Without a Brain

Trees and plants do not have brains or a central nervous system like animals. Instead, they rely on a decentralized form of processing and response. When a tree sends a chemical signal through the mycorrhizal network, the receiving plants detect these chemicals through their own root systems. Each chemical signal can trigger specific responses, such as increasing the production of certain nutrients or releasing defensive chemicals to deter pests.

The ability of plants to distinguish between different signals is based on the receptors they have for various chemical compounds. When a receptor is activated by the corresponding chemical, it initiates a response in the plant. This is somewhat analogous to how sensory inputs work in animals, though without the centralized processing of a brain.

### 4. Resemblance to the Nervous System in Animals

While there are similarities in that both systems involve the transmission of signals and responses to stimuli, the mechanisms are fundamentally different. The animal nervous system relies on a centralized brain and a network of neurons to process information and coordinate responses. In contrast, plants use a decentralized, biochemical method of communication and response.

The resemblance lies in the functional aspect—both systems allow organisms to respond to their environment and communicate internally or with others. However, the underlying structures and processes are distinct, reflecting the different evolutionary paths of plants and animals.

### Conclusion

The "Wood Wide Web" is a complex and fascinating example of how life on Earth has evolved various means of communication and mutual support. Trees and plants may not have brains or nervous systems like animals, but they have developed their own sophisticated methods of sending, receiving, and responding to signals. This network of roots and fungi is a testament to the interconnectedness of life and the incredible adaptability of organisms to their environments.

> Communication[edit]<br>Reports discuss the ongoing debate within the scientific community regarding what constitutes communication, but the extent of communication influences how a biologist perceives behaviors. Communication is commonly defined as imparting or exchanging information. Biological communication, however, is often defined by how fitness in an organism is affected by the transfer of information in both the sender and the receiver. Signals are the result of evolved behavior in the sender and effect a change in the receiver by imparting information about the sender's environment. Cues are similar in origin but only effect the fitness of the receiver. Both signals and cues are important elements of communication, but workers maintain caution as to when it can be determined that transfer of information benefits both senders and receivers. Thus, the extent of biological communication can be in question without rigorous experimentation. It has, therefore, been suggested that the term infochemical be used for chemical substances which can travel from one organism to another and elicit changes. This is important to understanding biological communication where it is not clearly delineated that communication involves a signal that can be adaptive to both sender and receiver.<br>Behavior and information transfer[edit]<br>A morphological or physiological change in a plant due to a signal or cue from its environment constitutes behavior in plants, and plants connected by a mycorrhizal network have the ability to alter their behavior based on the signals or cues they receive from other plants. These signals or cues can be biochemical, electrical, or can involve nutrient transfer. Plants release chemicals both above and below the ground to communicate with their neighbors to reduce damage from their environment. Changes in plant behavior invoked by the transfer of infochemicals vary depending on environmental factors, the types of plants involved and the type of mycorrhizal network. In a study of trifoliate orange seedlings, mycorrhizal networks acted to transfer infochemicals, and the presence of a mycorrhizal network affected the growth of plants and enhanced production of signaling molecules. One argument in support of the claim mycorrhizal can transfer various infochemicals is that they have been shown to transfer molecules such as lipids, carbohydrates and amino acids. Thus, transfer of infochemicals via mycorrhizal networks can act to influence plant behavior.<br>There are three main types of infochemicals shown to act as response inducing signals or cues by plants in mycorrhizal networks, as evidenced by increased effects on plant behavior: allelochemicals, defensive chemicals and nutrients.<br>Allelopathic communication[edit]<br>Allelopathy is the process by which plants produce secondary metabolites known as allelochemicals, which can interfere with the development of other plants or organisms. Allelochemicals can affect nutrient uptake, photosynthesis and growth; furthermore, they can down regulate defense genes, affect mitochondrial function, and disrupt membrane permeability leading to issues with respiration.<br>Plants produce many types of allelochemicals, such as thiophenes and juglone, which can be volatilized or exuded by the roots into the rhizosphere. Plants release allelochemicals due to biotic and abiotic stresses in their environment and often release them in conjunction with defensive compounds. In order for allelochemicals to have a detrimental effect on a target plant, they must exist in high enough concentrations to be toxic, but, much like animal pheromones, allelochemicals are released in very small amounts and rely on the reaction of the target plant to amplify their effects. Due to their lower concentrations and the ease in which they are degraded in the environment, the toxicity of allelochemicals is limited by soil moisture, soil structure, and organic matter types and microbes present in soils. The effectiveness of allelopathic interactions has been called into question in native habitats due to the effects of them passing through soils, but studies have shown that mycorrhizal networks make their transfer more efficient. These infochemicals are hypothesized to be able to travel faster via mycorrhizal networks, because the networks protect them from some hazards of being transmitted through the soil, such as leaching and degradation. This increased transfer speed is hypothesized to occur if the allelochemicals move via water on hyphal surfaces or by cytoplasmic streaming. Studies have reported concentrations of allelochemicals two to four times higher in plants connected by mycorrhizal networks. Thus, mycorrhizal networks can facilitate the transfer of these infochemicals.<br>Studies have demonstrated correlations between increased levels of allelochemicals in target plants and the presence of mycorrhizal networks. These studies strongly suggest that mycorrhizal networks increase the transfer of allelopathic chemicals and expand the range, called the bioactive zone, in which they can disperse and maintain their function. Furthermore, studies indicate increased bioactive zones aid in the effectiveness of the allelochemicals because these infochemicals cannot travel very far without a mycorrhizal network. There was greater accumulation of allelochemicals, such as thiopenes and the herbicide imazamox, in target plants connected to a supplier plant via a mycorrhizal network than without that connection, supporting the conclusion that the mycorrhizal network increased the bioactive zone of the allelochemical. Allelopathic chemicals have also been demonstrated to inhibit target plant growth when target and supplier are connected via AM networks. The black walnut is one of the earliest studied examples of allelopathy and produces juglone, which inhibits growth and water uptake in neighboring plants. In studies of juglone in black walnuts and their target species, the presence of mycorrhizal networks caused target plants to exhibit reduced growth by increasing the transfer of the infochemical. Spotted knapweed, an allelopathic invasive species, provides further evidence of the ability of mycorrhizal networks to contribute to the transfer of allelochemicals. Spotted knapweed can alter which plant species a certain AM fungus prefers to connect to, changing the structure of the network so that the invasive plant shares a network with its target. These and other studies provide evidence that  mycorrhizal networks can facilitate the effects on plant behavior caused by allelochemicals.<br>Defensive communication[edit]<br>Mycorrhizal networks can connect many different plants and provide shared pathways by which plants can transfer infochemicals related to attacks by pathogens or herbivores, allowing receiving plants to react in the same way as the infected or infested plants. A variety of plant derived substances act as these infochemicals.<br>When plants are attacked they can manifest physical changes, such as strengthening their cell walls, depositing callose, or forming cork. They can also manifest biochemical changes, including the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or the upregulation of genes producing other defensive enzymes, many of which are toxic to pathogens or herbivores. Salicylic acid (SA) and its derivatives, like methyl salicylate, are VOCs which help plants to recognize infection or attack and to organize other plant defenses, and exposure to them in animals can cause pathological processes. Terpenoids are produced constituently in many plants or are produced as a response to stress and act much like methyl salicylate. Jasmonates are a class of VOCs produced by the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. Jasmonates are used in plant defense against insects and pathogens and can cause the expression of proteases, which defend against insect attack. Plants have many ways to react to attack, including the production of VOCs, which studies report can coordinate defenses among plants connected by mycorrhizal networks.<br>Many studies report that mycorrhizal networks facilitate the coordination of defenses between connected plants using volatile organic compounds and other plant defensive enzymes acting as infochemicals.<br>Priming occurs when a plant's defenses are activated before an attack. Studies have shown that priming of plant defenses among plants in mycorrhizal networks may be activated by the networks, as they make it easier for these infochemicals to propagate among the connected plants. The defenses of uninfected plants are primed by their response via the network to the terpenoids produced by the infected plants. AM networks can prime plant defensive reactions by causing them to increase the production of terpenoids.<br>In a study of tomato plants connected via an AM mycorrhizal network, a plant not infected by a fungal pathogen showed evidence of defensive priming when another plant in the network was infected, causing the uninfected plant to upregulate genes for the SA and JA pathways. Similarly, aphid-free plants were shown to only be able to express the SA pathways when a mycorrhizal network connected them to infested plants. Furthermore, only then did they display resistance to the herbivore, showing that the plants were able to transfer defensive infochemicals via the mycorrhizal network.<br>Many insect herbivores are drawn to their food by VOCs. When the plant is consumed, however, the composition of the VOCs change, which can then cause them to repel the herbivores and attract insect predators, such as parasitoid wasps. Methyl salicylate was shown to be the primary VOC produced by beans in a study which demonstrated this effect. It was found to be in high concentrations in infested and uninfested plants, which were only connected via a mycorrhizal network. A plant sharing a mycorrhizal network with another that is attacked will display similar defensive strategies, and its defenses will be primed to increase the production of toxins or chemicals which repel attackers or attract defensive species.<br>In another study, introduction of budworm to Douglas fir trees led to increased production of defensive enzymes in uninfested ponderosa pines connected to the damaged tree by an ECM network. This effect demonstrates that defensive infochemicals transferred through such a network can cause rapid increases in resistance and defense in uninfested plants of a different species.<br>The results of these studies support the conclusion that both ECM and AM networks provide pathways for defensive infochemicals from infected or infested hosts to induce defensive changes in uninfected or uninfested conspecific and heterospecific plants, and that some recipient species generally receive less damage from infestation or infection.

> Nutrient transfer[edit]<br>Numerous studies have reported that carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are transferred between conspecific and heterospecific plants via AM and ECM networks. Other nutrients may also be transferred, as strontium and rubidium, which are calcium and potassium analogs respectively, have also been reported to move via an AM network between conspecific plants. Scientists believe that transfer of nutrients by way of mycorrhizal networks could act to alter the behavior of receiving plants by inducing physiological or biochemical changes, and there is evidence that these changes have improved nutrition, growth and survival of receiving plants.<br>Mechanisms[edit]<br>Several mechanisms have been observed and proposed by which nutrients can move between plants connected by a mycorrhizal network, including source-sink relationships, preferential transfer and kin related mechanisms.<br>Transfer of nutrients can follow a source–sink relationship where nutrients move from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. An experiment with grasses and forbs from a California oak woodland showed that nutrients were transferred between plant species via an AM mycorrhizal network, with different species acting as sources and sinks for different elements. Nitrogen has also been shown to flow from nitrogen-fixing plants to non-nitrogen fixing plants through a mycorrhizal network following a source-sink relationship.<br>It has been demonstrated that mechanisms exist by which mycorrhizal fungi can preferentially allocate nutrients to certain plants without a source–sink relationship. Studies have also detailed bidirectional transfer of nutrients between plants connected by a network, and evidence indicates that carbon can be shared between plants unequally, sometimes to the benefit of one species over another.<br>Kinship can act as another transfer mechanism. More carbon has been found to be exchanged between the roots of more closely related Douglas firs sharing a network than more distantly related roots. Evidence is also mounting that micronutrients transferred via mycorrhizal networks can communicate relatedness between plants. Carbon transfer between Douglas fir seedlings led workers to hypothesize that micronutrient transfer via the network may have increased carbon transfer between related plants.<br>These transfer mechanisms can facilitate movement of nutrients via mycorrhizal networks and result in behavioral modifications in connected plants, as indicated by morphological or physiological changes, due to the infochemicals being transmitted. One study reported a threefold increase in photosynthesis in a paper birch transferring carbon to a Douglas fir, indicating a physiological change in the tree which produced the signal. Photosynthesis was also shown to be increased in Douglas fir seedlings by the transport of carbon, nitrogen and water from an older tree connected by a mycorrhizal network. Furthermore, nutrient transfer from older to younger trees on a network can dramatically increase growth rates of the younger receivers. Physiological changes due to environmental stress have also initiated nutrient transfer by causing the movement of carbon from the roots of the stressed plant to the roots of a conspecific plant over a mycorrhizal network. Thus, nutrients transferred through mychorrhizal networks act as signals and cues to change the behavior of the connected plants.

> Types[edit]<br>There are two main types of mycorrhizal networks: arbuscular mycorrhizal networks and ectomycorrhizal networks.<br>Arbuscular mycorrhizal networks are formed between plants that associate with glomeromycetes. Arbuscular mycorrhizal associations (also called endomycorrhizas) predominate among land plants, and are formed with 150–200 known fungal species, although true fungal diversity may be much higher.<br>Ectomycorrhizal networks are formed between plants that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi and proliferate by way of ectomycorrhizal extramatrical mycelium. In contrast to glomeromycetes, ectomycorrhizal fungal are a highly diverse and polyphyletic group consisting of 10,000 fungal species. These associations tend to be more specific, and predominate in temperate and boreal forests.
