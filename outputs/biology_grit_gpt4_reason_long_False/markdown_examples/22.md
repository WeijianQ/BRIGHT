## Original Question

*Why do mints make your mouth feel cold?
Why do mints make your mouth feel cold? And specifically, why does your mouth feel so cold if you eat a few mints and then drink a glass of cold water afterwards?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here revolves around understanding the sensory experience of coolness in the mouth when consuming mints, especially when followed by drinking cold water. To address this, we need to explore the nature of mints, the active ingredients involved, and how human sensory perception, particularly the sensation of temperature, works.

1. **Nature of Mints and Active Ingredients**: Mints, particularly peppermint, contain menthol. Menthol is an organic compound that is responsible for the cooling sensation we experience. It's not just found in mints but also in various other products like toothpaste, chewing gum, and sore throat lozenges.

2. **How Menthol Works**: The cool feeling from menthol does not actually lower the temperature in your mouth. Instead, menthol works by binding to a specific type of receptor in the sensory neurons of your skin and mucous membranes (like those in your mouth). These receptors, known as TRPM8 channels or cold and menthol receptors, are activated by low temperatures and menthol. When menthol binds to these receptors, they send signals to the brain that are interpreted as cold, even in the absence of actual cold temperatures.

3. **Sensory Perception of Temperature**: Our perception of temperature is relative and can be influenced by various factors, including prior conditions. When you consume mints, the menthol activates the TRPM8 receptors, creating a sensation of coolness. This sensation primes your sensory system to be more sensitive to temperature changes.

4. **Interaction with Cold Water**: Drinking cold water after eating mints amplifies the cold sensation for a couple of reasons. First, the water is genuinely cold, further activating the TRPM8 receptors that were already sensitized by the menthol. Second, the presence of menthol might make the receptors more responsive or lower their threshold for activation by cold temperatures, making the cold water feel even colder than it would otherwise.

5. **Summary**: The cool sensation from mints is due to menthol's activation of cold-sensitive receptors in the mouth. Drinking cold water after consuming mints amplifies this sensation because the menthol makes these receptors more sensitive to actual cold temperatures. This combination of chemical activation and genuine temperature change creates an intensified sensation of coldness.

Understanding this process involves a combination of chemistry, biology, and sensory perception, illustrating how our bodies interpret external stimuli and how certain substances can modulate these perceptions.

Menthol has anesthetic properties similar to, though less potent than, propofol because it interacts with the same sites on the GABAA receptor.

> Function[edit]<br>TRP channels modulate ion entry driving forces and Ca and Mg transport machinery in the plasma membrane, where most of them are located.  TRPs have important interactions with other proteins and often form signaling complexes, the exact pathways of which are unknown. TRP channels were initially discovered in the trp mutant strain of the fruit fly Drosophila which displayed transient elevation of potential in response to light stimuli and were so named transient receptor potential channels. TRPML channels function as intracellular calcium release channels and thus serve an important role in organelle regulation. Importantly, many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations like the sensations of pain, temperature, different kinds of taste, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and are used in animals to sense hot or cold. TRPs act as sensors of osmotic pressure, volume, stretch, and vibration. TRPs have been seen to have complex multidimensional roles in sensory signaling. Many TRPs function as intracellular calcium release channels.<br>Pain and temperature sensation[edit]<br>TRP ion channels convert energy into action potentials in somatosensory nociceptors.  Thermo-TRP channels have a C-terminal domain that is responsible for thermosensation and have a specific interchangeable region that allows them to sense temperature stimuli that is tied to ligand regulatory processes.  Although most TRP channels are modulated by changes in temperature, some have a crucial role in temperature sensation. There are at least 6 different Thermo-TRP channels and each plays a different role.  For instance, TRPM8 relates to mechanisms of sensing cold, TRPV1 and TRPM3 contribute to heat and inflammation sensations, and TRPA1 facilitates many signaling pathways like sensory transduction, nociception, inflammation and oxidative stress.<br>Taste[edit]<br>TRPM5 is involved in taste signaling of sweet, bitter and umami tastes by modulating the signal pathway in type II taste receptor cells. TRPM5 is activated by the sweet glycosides found in the stevia plant.<br>Several other TRP channels play a significant role in chemosensation through sensory nerve endings in the mouth that are independent from taste buds. TRPA1 responds to mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), wasabi, and cinnamon, TRPA1 and TRPV1 responds to garlic (allicin), TRPV1 responds to chilli pepper (capsaicin), TRPM8 is activated by menthol, camphor, peppermint, and cooling agents; TRPV2 is activated by molecules (THC, CBD and CBN) found in marijuana.
