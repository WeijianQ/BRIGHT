## Original Question

*Does the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 end with 33 A's?
Looking at the DNA (or RNA?) sequence of the Covid-19 virus here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3
I notice it ends in 33 a's. Does the virus really look like that, or is it some artifact of the sequencing process, or some sort of padding to round out numbers?
Here's the last few lines:

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential question here is whether the sequence of 33 adenine (A) nucleotides at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, as seen in the referenced NCBI database entry (MN908947.3), is a genuine part of the virus's genome or if it represents an artifact of the sequencing process or some form of padding.

### Understanding the Virus's Genome

First, it's important to clarify that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, has an RNA genome, not DNA. This genome is approximately 30,000 nucleotides long and encodes for various proteins necessary for the virus's replication and infection process. The sequencing of such a genome is crucial for understanding the virus's behavior, mutations, and for developing vaccines and treatments.

### The Role of Poly(A) Tails

In molecular biology, polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This modification has several roles in the mRNA lifecycle, including stability and regulation of translation. In eukaryotic cells, the poly(A) tail is added post-transcriptionally. However, several viruses, particularly those with RNA genomes like coronaviruses, encode a poly(A) tail within their genome sequence as part of their strategy to mimic host mRNA and hijack the host's cellular machinery for protein synthesis.

### Addressing the Question

Given this background, the presence of a sequence of 33 adenines (A's) at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence can be interpreted in a few ways:

1. **Genuine Poly(A) Tail**: It is plausible that this sequence represents a genuine poly(A) tail encoded by the virus. This would not be unusual for an RNA virus, as the poly(A) tail is a known feature that plays a role in the stability and translation of viral RNA.

2. **Sequencing Artifact or Padding**: In sequencing projects, especially for high-throughput sequencing technologies, various artifacts can be introduced into the data. However, given the critical nature of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing for global health, it's likely that the sequences deposited in public databases like NCBI have undergone rigorous quality control. Padding with adenines or any nucleotide would be an unusual practice for sequences submitted to such a database, as it could mislead research and diagnostic efforts.

3. **Biological Variation and Sequencing Techniques**: The length of the poly(A) tail can vary, and the exact number of adenines might not be perfectly conserved across all viral particles or might be influenced by the sequencing technique used. Different sequencing technologies might have varying efficiencies in accurately capturing the length of homopolymeric regions like poly(A) tails.

### Conclusion

The presence of the 33 adenine sequence at the end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the NCBI database is most likely a genuine representation of the virus's poly(A) tail, reflecting its RNA genome's natural structure. This feature is consistent with what is known about RNA viruses and their replication strategies. While artifacts from sequencing can occur, the context and the critical importance of accurate SARS-CoV-2 sequencing suggest that this is a true biological feature rather than an artifact or padding.

Another protein, PAB2, binds to the new, short poly(A) tail and increases the affinity of polyadenylate polymerase for the RNA. When the poly(A) tail is approximately 250 nucleotides long the enzyme can no longer bind to CPSF and polyadenylation stops, thus determining the length of

> Polyadenylation is the addition of a poly(A) tail to an RNA transcript, typically a messenger RNA (mRNA). The poly(A) tail consists of multiple adenosine monophosphates; in other words, it is a stretch of RNA that has only adenine bases. In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is part of the process that produces mature mRNA for translation. In many bacteria, the poly(A) tail promotes degradation of the mRNA. It, therefore, forms part of the larger process of gene expression.<br>The process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene terminates. The 3′-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off by a set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3′ end. In some genes these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing.<br>The poly(A) tail is important for the nuclear export, translation and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.<br>mRNA molecules in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes have polyadenylated 3′-ends, with the prokaryotic poly(A) tails generally shorter and fewer mRNA molecules polyadenylated.

> In prokaryotes and organelles[edit]<br>Polyadenylation in bacteria helps polynucleotide phosphorylase degrade past secondary structure<br>In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail promotes degradation by the degradosome, which contains two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and RNase E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3′ end of RNAs and the 3′ extension provided by the poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3′ end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3′ end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.<br>In as different groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones start at the stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation. Mitochondrial polyadenylation has never been observed in either budding or fission yeast.<br>While many bacteria and mitochondria have polyadenylate polymerases, they also have another type of polyadenylation, performed by polynucleotide phosphorylase itself. This enzyme is found in bacteria, mitochondria, plastids and as a constituent of the archaeal exosome (in those archaea that have an exosome). It can synthesise a 3′ extension where the vast majority of the bases are adenines. Like in bacteria, polyadenylation by polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes degradation of the RNA in plastids and likely also archaea.
