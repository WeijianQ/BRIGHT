## Original Question

*Why does mouldy food make you sick?
Bread gets mouldy pretty quickly. My parents (both of whom are nurses) throw out a loaf of bread after a spot of mould is seen (because "if you can see one spot, it means the whole thing is covered in mould spores") because they say you'll get sick if you eat it. The USDA also has a handy chart on it's mould page telling you when you should discard food with mould on it.
Is it the mould itself that makes us sick or is it something that the mould is releasing?
What are the mechanisms that cause us to feel sick after eating mouldy food?
The USDA says that there can also be bacteria along with the mould on the the food - is this what is really making us feel ill?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why consuming moldy food can make us sick and discerning whether it's the mold itself, something the mold releases, or potentially accompanying bacteria that causes illness. To address these questions, let's break down the information step by step.

### 1. What is Mold?

Mold is a type of fungus that can grow on food, especially in warm, damp conditions. It reproduces through tiny spores that float through the air, which is why it can spread and contaminate food quickly. When you see a spot of mold on bread, for instance, there are likely many more spores present that are not visible to the naked eye.

### 2. How Mold Makes You Sick

#### Mold Itself

- **Direct Ingestion**: Some molds produce toxic substances known as mycotoxins. When ingested, these toxins can lead to food poisoning symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, more serious health issues like liver damage or respiratory problems. Not all molds produce mycotoxins, but the risk is significant enough that it's safer to avoid eating moldy food.

- **Allergic Reactions and Respiratory Problems**: For some individuals, exposure to mold can trigger allergic reactions or exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma. These reactions can occur from inhaling mold spores or from consuming moldy food.

#### Substances Released by Mold

- **Mycotoxins**: As mentioned, these are toxic compounds produced by certain types of mold. They are a primary concern when it comes to the health risks associated with consuming moldy food. Mycotoxins are stable and can survive food processing, making them particularly dangerous.

#### Accompanying Bacteria

- **Secondary Contamination**: While mold growth is the visible sign of spoilage, it can also indicate the presence of bacteria. Foods that are moldy may also be hosting bacteria like Salmonella, E. coli, or Listeria, which can cause foodborne illness. The moist, nutrient-rich environments that support mold growth can also support bacterial growth, though not all moldy foods will necessarily have harmful bacteria.

### 3. Mechanisms of Illness

- **Ingestion of Mycotoxins**: Consuming mycotoxins can lead to acute poisoning or long-term health effects depending on the type and amount of toxin ingested.

- **Allergic Reactions**: The immune system's response to mold can cause symptoms ranging from mild (sneezing, coughing) to severe (asthma attacks).

- **Infection**: In rare cases, consuming moldy food can lead to fungal infections. This is more common in individuals with weakened immune systems.

- **Bacterial Food Poisoning**: If the moldy food also harbors pathogenic bacteria, ingestion can lead to symptoms like stomach cramps, diarrhea, and fever.

### Conclusion

Both the mold itself and the substances it releases can make you sick, primarily through the production of mycotoxins. The presence of bacteria alongside mold can also contribute to the risk of illness. This is why it's advised to discard moldy food, even if the mold is only visible in small amounts, as it indicates a broader contamination that could pose health risks. Your parents' approach, informed by their medical background, aligns with the USDA's recommendations to ensure food safety and prevent potential health issues related to mold consumption.

> Pathology[edit]<br>No animal species is known to be immune to the acute toxic effects of aflatoxins. Adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis, but children are particularly affected, and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development, in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below.<br>High-level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute hepatic necrosis (acute aflatoxicosis), resulting later in cirrhosis or carcinoma of the liver. Acute liver failure is made manifest by bleeding, edema, alteration in digestion, changes to the absorption and/or metabolism of nutrients, and mental changes and/or coma.<br>Chronic, subclinical exposure does not lead to symptoms so dramatic as acute aflatoxicosis. Chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer, as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into DNA and alkylate the bases through epoxide moiety. This is thought to cause mutations in the p53 gene, an important gene in preventing cell cycle progression when there are DNA mutations, or signaling apoptosis (programmed cell death). These mutations seem to affect some base pair locations more than others, for example, the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene appears to be more susceptible to aflatoxin-mediated mutations than nearby bases. As with other DNA-alkylating agents, Aflatoxin B1 can cause immune suppression, and exposure to it is associated with an increased viral load in HIV positive individuals.<br>The expression of aflatoxin-related diseases is influenced by factors such as species, age, nutrition, sex, and the possibility of concurrent exposure to other toxins. The main target organ in mammals is the liver, so aflatoxicosis primarily is a hepatic disease. Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control.<br>A regular diet including apiaceous vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, celery, and parsley may reduce the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin.<br>There is no specific antidote for aflatoxicosis. Symptomatic and supportive care tailored to the severity of the liver disease may include intravenous fluids with dextrose, active vitamin K, B vitamins, and a restricted, but high-quality protein diet with adequate carbohydrate content.<br>In other animals[edit]<br>In dogs, aflatoxin has potential to lead to liver disease. Low levels of aflatoxin exposure require continuous consumption for several weeks to months in order for signs of liver dysfunction to appear. Some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100–300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis. No information is available to suggest that recovered dogs will later succumb to an aflatoxin-induced disease.<br>Turkeys are extremely susceptible to aflatoxicosis. Recent studies have revealed that this is due to the efficient cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of aflatoxin B1 in the liver of turkeys and deficient glutathione-S-transferase mediated detoxification.<br>Some studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin B1 (4 mg/kg, single dose) and the appearance of developmental anomalies in their offspring.<br>In 2005, Diamond Pet Foods discovered aflatoxin in a product manufactured at their facility in Gaston, South Carolina. In 23 states, Diamond voluntarily recalled 19 products formulated with corn and manufactured in the Gaston facility. Testing of more than 2,700 finished product samples conducted by laboratories confirmed that only two date codes of two adult dog formulas had the potential to be toxic.<br>In December 2020 and January 2021, Midwestern Pet Foods recalled dog food that contained fatal levels of aflatoxin. As many as 70 dogs had died from aflatoxin poisoning by January 12, 2021.

> Prevention[edit]<br>A primary means of limiting risk from aflatoxins in the food supply is food hygiene in the commercial commodity supply chain, such as rejecting moldy grain for use in food processing plants and testing of batches of ingredients for aflatoxin levels before adding them to the mix. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA set limits on acceptable levels. Grain drying itself, which is necessary for viable combine harvesting in many regions, lays the fundamentals for this effort by preventing stored grain from being too damp in the first place.<br>There is very limited evidence to show that agricultural and nutritional education can reduce exposure to aflatoxin in low to middle income countries.

> Contamination conditions[edit]<br>Aflatoxins are produced by both Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, which are common forms of 'weedy' molds widespread in nature. The presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present, but does indicate a significant risk. The molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage, especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment, or to stressful conditions such as drought. Aflatoxin contamination is increasing in crops such as maize as a result of climate change creating better conditions for these molds.<br>The native habitat of Aspergillus is in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration, but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions for production of aflatoxins include high moisture content (at least 7%) and temperatures from 55 °F (13 °C) to 104 °F (40 °C) [optimum 27 to 30 °C (81 to 86 °F)]. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chilies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains.<br>A study conducted in Kenya and Mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins.<br>Organic crops, which are not treated with fungicides, may be more susceptible to contamination with aflatoxins.

> Aflatoxins are various poisonous carcinogens and mutagens that are produced by certain molds, particularly Aspergillus species mainly by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. According to the USDA, "They are probably the best known and most intensively researched mycotoxins in the world." The fungi grow in soil, decaying vegetation and various staple foodstuffs and commodities such as hay, maize, peanuts, coffee, wheat, millet, sorghum, cassava, rice, chili peppers, cottonseed, tree nuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and various cereal grains and oil seeds. In short, the relevant fungi grow on almost any crop or food. When such contaminated food is processed or consumed, the aflatoxins enter the general food supply. They have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into milk, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is the suspected source of aflatoxin-contaminated chicken meat and eggs in Pakistan.<br>Children are particularly vulnerable to aflatoxin exposure, which is linked to immune suppression, stunted growth, delayed development, aflatoxicosis, food spoilage and liver cancer. Some studies have reported an association between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure, although this link has not been consistently detected in all studies. but could not be detected in all. Furthermore, a causal relationship between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure has yet to be conclusively shown by epidemiological studies, though such investigations are underway. Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is known to be immune. Aflatoxins are among the most carcinogenic substances known. After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactive epoxide intermediate or hydroxylated to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1.<br>Aflatoxin poisoning most commonly results from ingestion, but the most toxic aflatoxin compound, B1, can permeate through the skin.<br>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action levels for aflatoxin present in food or feed is 20 to 300 ppb. The FDA has had occasion to declare both human and pet food recalls as a precautionary measure to prevent exposure.<br>The term "aflatoxin" is derived from the name of the species Aspergillus flavus, in which some of the compounds first were discovered. A new disease was identified with unknown characteristics in England during the 1950s and 1960s, which increased turkey mortality. Later, aflatoxin was recognized in 1960 in England as a causative agent of the mysterious Turkey ‘X’ disease that causes excessive mortality in turkey poults. Aflatoxins form one of the major groupings of mycotoxins, and apart from Aspergillus flavus various members of the group of compounds occur in species such as: Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus pseudocaelatus, Aspergillus pseudonomius, and Aspergillus nomius.
