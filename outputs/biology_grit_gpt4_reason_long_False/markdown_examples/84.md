## Original Question

*Why is funnel web spider venom so lethal to humans and not so much for other mammals?
According to the information from this article,
People and other primates are exquisitely sensitive to funnel web venom but, intriguingly, other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guineapigs, dogs and cats are relatively immune and often survive 100 times the human lethal dosage.
Why is the funnel web spider venom so much more lethal for humans and primates than other mammals?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why funnel web spider venom is significantly more lethal to humans and other primates compared to other mammals such as mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, and cats. To address this question, we need to delve into several aspects of biology, toxicology, and evolutionary biology.

**1. Composition of Funnel Web Spider Venom:**
The first step is to consider the specific components of funnel web spider venom. Like many venoms, it is a complex cocktail of various molecules, including peptides and proteins that can affect the nervous system, interfere with cellular functions, or disrupt blood coagulation. Identifying the specific toxins that are particularly harmful to primates could provide clues to their potency in humans versus other animals.

**2. Primate Physiology vs. Other Mammals:**
Next, we should compare the physiological differences between primates (including humans) and other mammals that might explain the discrepancy in venom lethality. This includes differences in the nervous system, such as the types and distribution of ion channels and receptors that the venom components target. If the venom's toxins are more effective at binding to or interfering with the ion channels or receptors prevalent in primates, this could account for the increased sensitivity.

**3. Evolutionary Aspects:**
Another angle to consider is the evolutionary relationship between the funnel web spider and its prey or predators. It's possible that these spiders evolved venom components specifically to target the species they frequently encountered or needed defense against, which may not have included the ancestors of modern primates. This evolutionary 'arms race' can lead to a situation where venom is highly specialized and more effective against certain species over others.

**4. Genetic Factors:**
Differences in genetic makeup between primates and other mammals could also play a role. If primates share a genetic trait that makes them more susceptible to the effects of the venom, this could explain the observed sensitivity. This could be related to the expression levels of certain proteins, the presence of specific receptors that the venom targets, or differences in the metabolic pathways that could detoxify the venom.

**5. Immunological Responses:**
The immune response to venom can also vary significantly between species. It's possible that primates have a more aggressive or less effective immune response to funnel web spider venom, leading to more severe outcomes. Understanding the immunological differences could shed light on why primates are more affected.

In conclusion, the lethal effect of funnel web spider venom on humans and other primates compared to other mammals likely results from a complex interplay of the venom's biochemical composition, differences in primate physiology, evolutionary factors, genetic predispositions, and perhaps differences in immune response. Research into these areas could provide a more detailed understanding of this phenomenon, which could be crucial for developing more effective antivenoms and treatments.

> Mechanism of action[edit]<br>Delta atracotoxin is responsible for the potentially lethal envenomation syndrome seen following funnel-web spider envenomation. d-Atracotoxins induce spontaneous, repetitive firing and prolongation of action potentials resulting in continuous acetylcholine neurotransmitter release from somatic and autonomic nerve endings. This will lead to slower voltage-gated sodium channel inactivation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation. This action is due to voltage-dependent binding to neurotoxin receptor site-3 in a similar, but not identical, fashion to scorpion a-toxins and sea anemone toxins.<br>In the sea anemone and scorpion toxins, combinations of charged (especially cationic) and hydrophobic side-chains are important for binding to their receptor site (site 3) on the sodium channel. It will therefore be not surprising to find that the same applies to delta atracotoxin and versutoxin (a close homologue of delta atracotoxin). Delta atracotoxin presents three distinct charged patches on its surface, as well as a non-polar region centered on the 22-28 loop. Both of these structural features may play a role in its binding to the voltage-gated sodium channel, but further studies are necessary in defining which residues are important for interaction with the sodium channel so that a plausible model can be constructed of its binding site.<br>Synthetic[edit]<br>The availability of synthetic toxin has allowed scientists to further explore the biological activity of the toxin, resulting in the observation that d-ACTX-Ar1a causes repetitive firing and prolongation of the action potential. These actions underlie the clinical symptoms seen following envenomation and further contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis for activity of this potent neurotoxin on voltage-gated sodium channels.<br>Under voltage-clamp conditions in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons it was found that the effects of the synthetic toxin on sodium currents were not significantly different from those previously reported for the native toxin. Neither native nor synthetic d-ACTX-Ar1a had any effect on TTX-resistant sodium currents, but both exerted a potent selective modulation of TTX-sensitive sodium currents consistent with actions on neurotoxin receptor site-3. This includes a slowing of the sodium-channel inactivation, a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of activation and a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state sodium-channel inactivation.<br>d-ACTX-Ar1a causes a prolongation of action potential duration, accompanied by spontaneous repetitive firing, but does not depolarize the resting membrane potential. Effects on the autonomic nervous system, including vomiting, profuse sweating, salivation, lachrymation, marked hypertension followed by hypotension, together with effect on the somatic nervous system to cause muscle fasciculation and dyspnea (shortness of breath) are presumably due to excessive transmitter release. To identify the sodium-channel binding surface of d-ACTX-Ar1a, scientist must synthesize analogues with selected residue changes. Studies will contribute to a more detailed mapping of site-3, the neurotoxin receptor site on the sodium-channel and provide structure-activity data critical for determining the phylaspecific actions of this and related atracotoxins.

> Signs and symptoms[edit]<br>The bite of a Sydney funnel web spider is at first painful, due to the large fangs and acidic pH of the venom. If there is no immediate treatment symptoms may arise beginning ten minutes after the bite. Hypertension may occur, which is often followed by a prolonged hypotension and  circulatory failure. Other symptoms include dyspnea and ultimately respiratory failure, generalized skeletal muscle fasciculation, salivation, lachrymation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pulmonary edema and pain.<br>The progress of the envenomation is precisely studied in primates, which symptoms are very similar to those of humans. In the first 25 minutes after envenomation disturbances in respiration occur, which gradually become worse. Some monkeys required artificial ventilation. Initially, the blood pressure decreased, but then quickly rose, after which the blood pressure gradually declined. After 40–100 minutes severe hypotension occurred.<br>Lachrymation started after 6–15 minutes and was followed by salivation.
