# Query `32`

## Original Question

*Why can't humans drink sea water?
It would seem to be a huge evolutionary advantage for an animal to be able to drink sea water rather than have to rely on fresh water, and it's provably not impossible due to the existence of sea mammals that must filter the sea water somehow.
Could someone explain to me any likely reasons that this is the case?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding why humans cannot drink sea water and considering why it hasn't evolved as a trait given its apparent survival advantage, especially when some sea mammals can consume sea water indirectly through their food or have specialized adaptations to process it.

1. **Salinity of Sea Water**: The primary reason humans cannot drink sea water is its high salt content. Sea water contains about 3.5% salt by weight, primarily sodium chloride, along with other minerals. This concentration is much higher than the levels of salt in the human body, which are carefully regulated.

2. **Osmoregulation in Humans**: Osmoregulation is the process by which living organisms maintain the proper balance of salts and water in their bodies. Humans have a specific range of salt concentration they can tolerate. Drinking sea water, with its high salt content, disrupts this balance.

3. **Effect of Drinking Sea Water**: When sea water is ingested, the body tries to dilute the excess salt by pulling water from its cells into the bloodstream, eventually increasing the volume of blood and raising blood pressure. The kidneys then try to excrete the excess salt, but since sea water contains more salt than the kidneys can expel (the kidneys can only produce urine that is less salty than sea water), this leads to further dehydration rather than rehydration.

4. **Evolutionary Perspective**: From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability to drink sea water would indeed be advantageous. However, evolution is guided by many factors, including mutations, genetic variation, and environmental pressures. For early humans and their ancestors, who evolved in terrestrial environments where fresh water was accessible, there might have been little evolutionary pressure to develop the ability to consume sea water. The physiological changes required to adapt to drinking sea water would be significant, involving major alterations in kidney function and possibly other organ systems.

5. **Comparisons with Sea Mammals**: Some marine mammals have evolved to live in oceanic environments and have adaptations that allow them to manage the high salt content. For example, many sea mammals obtain fresh water from their food (fish and marine organisms that contain less salt than sea water) and have kidneys that are highly efficient at removing salt from their bloodstream. Seals, for instance, have kidneys that can produce urine that is more concentrated with salt than sea water, allowing them to conserve water. These adaptations are the result of millions of years of evolution in marine environments.

6. **Human Adaptations to Scarcity of Fresh Water**: Humans have developed various behavioral adaptations to deal with the scarcity of fresh water, such as the creation of tools and techniques for finding, storing, and transporting fresh water, as well as methods for desalinating water. These cultural and technological advancements have allowed humans to inhabit areas where fresh water is not readily available.

In summary, the inability of humans to drink sea water is primarily due to the high salt content that disrupts the body's osmotic balance, leading to dehydration. While evolving the ability to consume sea water could have been advantageous, the evolutionary pressures and the environmental contexts of early human ancestors did not favor the development of such physiological adaptations. Instead, humans have relied on behavioral and technological solutions to address the challenge of accessing fresh water.
