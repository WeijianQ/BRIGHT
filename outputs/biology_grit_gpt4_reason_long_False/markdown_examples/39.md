## Original Question

*Why does UV radiation from the Sun cause skin cancer?
What is the specific mechanism makes non-ionizing UVA and UVB radiation carcinogenic? Can lower energy light, like visible light, be carcinogenic because of this mechanism, or is there some kind of threshold within spectrum at which electromagnetic radiation does not induce cancer in humans?
Ionizing radiation can be mutagenic, which can cause cancer. However, this only applies to high-energy electromagnetic radiation with photon energies exceeding about 5 eV, or about 248 nm. (The FCC defines this threshold even higher at 10 eV, or about 124 nm!) These photon energies correspond to UVC, which is blocked thoroughly by the atmosphere, meaning Sunlight does not appreciably contribute to the ionizing radiation we receive on Earth. Therefore, the mechanism with which solar UV radiation induces cancer must be different from higher energy electromagnetic radiation, right?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding how non-ionizing ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun, specifically UVA and UVB rays, can cause skin cancer despite not being ionizing. This involves exploring the specific mechanisms through which these lower energy forms of electromagnetic radiation can lead to carcinogenic effects, and whether there's a threshold in the electromagnetic spectrum below which radiation does not induce cancer in humans.

### 1. How UV Radiation Causes Skin Cancer

#### **Mechanism of Damage by UVA and UVB**

- **Direct DNA Damage:** UVB radiation, with wavelengths between 280 nm and 320 nm, is primarily responsible for direct DNA damage. It causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers (thymine or cytosine dimers) in the DNA. These dimers can lead to mutations if not correctly repaired by the cell's DNA repair mechanisms. This kind of damage is a direct alteration of the DNA structure and is a critical step towards carcinogenesis.

- **Indirect DNA Damage:** UVA radiation, which has longer wavelengths (320 nm to 400 nm), primarily causes indirect DNA damage. It generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals within cells. These reactive molecules can then damage the DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. The oxidative stress from ROS can lead to mutations and other alterations conducive to cancer development.

- **Immune Suppression:** Both UVA and UVB radiation can suppress the local immune response in the skin. This suppression can prevent the immune system from detecting and destroying newly formed cancer cells, allowing them to proliferate.

### 2. Threshold of Carcinogenic Electromagnetic Radiation

- **Ionizing vs. Non-ionizing Radiation:** Ionizing radiation has enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, thus creating ions. It is well-established that ionizing radiation can cause DNA damage directly by breaking chemical bonds. This category includes X-rays and gamma rays. Non-ionizing radiation, like UVA and UVB, does not have sufficient energy to ionize atoms in this way but can still lead to cancer through the mechanisms described above.

- **Threshold Within the Spectrum:** The threshold for electromagnetic radiation to be considered ionizing, and thus directly mutagenic, is around 10 eV or wavelengths shorter than approximately 124 nm. UVA and UVB radiation, being non-ionizing with lower energy, cause cancer through different mechanisms than direct ionization. This suggests a functional threshold in the spectrum where the mechanism of carcinogenicity shifts from direct ionization to indirect damage, such as the generation of ROS and direct DNA damage that does not involve ionization.

### 3. Can Lower Energy Light Induce Cancer?

- **Visible Light and Below:** There's currently no strong evidence to suggest that visible light or lower energy electromagnetic radiation (infrared, microwave, radio waves) can cause cancer in the same way that UV radiation can. The energy of photons in the visible spectrum and below is not sufficient to directly damage DNA or produce the same level of harmful ROS that contributes to carcinogenesis.

- **Safety Thresholds:** While the exact "safe" threshold might be hard to pinpoint due to the different mechanisms of action, it is generally accepted that the risk of carcinogenesis significantly decreases as you move to lower energy wavelengths beyond UV. The body of evidence supports the notion that visible light and other lower energy forms of radiation do not induce cancer through the mechanisms associated with UV radiation.

### Conclusion

While ionizing radiation directly alters DNA through ionization, non-ionizing UVA and UVB radiation from the Sun can still induce skin cancer through indirect DNA damage, the generation of ROS, and immune suppression. There appears to be a threshold in the electromagnetic spectrum, around the UV range, below which radiation does not directly induce cancer through these mechanisms. Visible light and other lower-energy forms of radiation have not been shown to cause cancer via the mechanisms associated with UV radiation.

Unrepaired lesions may lead to erroneous nucleotide incorporation by polymerase machinery.

Unrectified lesions may also interfere with polymerase function, induce transcription or replication errors, or halt replication.

> Effect of topical sunscreen and effect of absorbed sunscreen[edit]<br>Direct DNA damage is reduced by sunscreen, which also reduces the risk of developing a sunburn.  When the sunscreen is at the surface of the skin, it filters the UV rays, which attenuates the intensity. Even when the sunscreen molecules have penetrated into the skin, they protect against direct DNA damage, because the UV light is absorbed by the sunscreen and not by the DNA. Sunscreen primarily works by absorbing the UV light from the sun through the use of organic compounds, such as oxybenzone or avobenzone. These compounds are able to absorb UV energy from the sun and transition into higher-energy states. Eventually, these molecules return to lower energy states, and in doing so, the initial energy from the UV light can be transformed into heat. This process of absorption works to reduce the risk of DNA damage and the formation of pyrimidine dimers. UVA light makes up 95% of the UV light that reaches earth, whereas UVB light makes up only about 5%. UVB light is the form of UV light that is responsible for tanning and burning. Sunscreens work to protect from both UVA and UVB rays. Overall, sunburns exemplify DNA damage caused by UV rays, and this damage can come in the form of free radical species, as well as dimerization of adjacent nucleotides.
