# Query `37`

## Original Question

*Why doesn't water enter my body through my anus or genitals when swimming?
So when we swim, we can make water not enter through our nose and mouth, simply by holding our breath. However, the mouth and the nose aren't the only cavities. What about the anus and the genitals? They obviously can't "hold breath", so how do they stop water from entering?
I thought the reason is gravity, but then, people would be killed when diving because your butt is facing up, against the gravity.
Another explanation might be that the internal pressure is higher than the external one, but I fail to recall any organ that creates the pressure..*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The question concerns why water does not enter our bodies through openings such as the anus or genitals when we swim or dive, despite these cavities not having the ability to "hold breath" like our mouth or nose. To address this question, let's consider several physiological and physical principles that contribute to this phenomenon.

### 1. **Anatomical Structure and Muscle Control**

Firstly, both the anus and the genitals are designed in such a way that involuntary muscle control plays a significant role in keeping these orifices closed. The anus, for instance, is sealed by the anal sphincters (internal and external), which are typically contracted and keep the opening closed. These muscles only relax to allow the passage of feces, and this relaxation is usually under voluntary control. Similarly, the urinary tract is designed to keep urine in and external substances out, with sphincter muscles controlling the release of urine.

### 2. **Pressure Dynamics**

While it might seem that the internal pressure versus external pressure argument does not hold because no organ is actively generating pressure to keep water out, the body's internal pressure is indeed generally higher than the external water pressure at the openings like the anus or genitals. This is because the body's tissues and fluids exert a pressure from within, which helps resist the passive entry of water. However, this doesn't mean that water cannot enter under certain conditions (e.g., high-pressure environments); it's just that under normal swimming conditions, this does not typically happen.

### 3. **Surface Tension and Viscosity**

The surface tension of water and the mucosal linings of these body cavities also play a role. The mucosal linings are slippery, which doesn't provide an easy "path" for water to flow into the body. Additionally, the surface tension of water means it doesn't easily move into small openings or against gravity without a force acting on it.

### 4. **Practical Considerations**

In practical scenarios, such as swimming or diving, the body is constantly moving. This movement, along with the tight closure of the sphincters, helps prevent water from entering. It's worth noting, though, that in situations where there is a significant force or pressure difference (e.g., high-speed water jets), water can potentially enter the body through these openings, although this is rare and usually requires quite specific conditions.

### Conclusion

In summary, a combination of anatomical structures (like sphincters), internal body pressure, the physical properties of water, and the body's movements while swimming contribute to preventing water from entering our bodies through the anus and genitals. While it's theoretically possible under extreme conditions for water to enter these cavities, under normal swimming or diving conditions, our bodies are well-equipped to keep water out.
