# Query `19`

## Original Question

*Is kissing a natural human activity?
The word natural here is meant in contrast to it being a sociological construct.
Is kissing in all its forms something natural for humans? Is it instinctively erotic? Or is it just a conventional form to show trust and intimicy, i.e. the association besically just comes via a social means?
Because the only other advantage of this mouth to mouth contact I could see is maybe for the immune system.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is to determine whether kissing is a natural human behavior in the sense of being an innate, biologically driven action, or if it is primarily a sociological construct—a behavior developed and perpetuated through social interaction and cultural practices. This inquiry touches upon the origins of kissing, its potential biological purposes, and its varied meanings across different cultures. To address this, we can explore several areas:

1. **Biological Basis of Kissing:**
   - Looking into the animal kingdom can provide some insights. Certain animals engage in behaviors that resemble kissing, such as bonobos, which use mouth-to-mouth contact as a form of social interaction. This could suggest a biological underpinning for kissing or similar behaviors.
   - Research on the human brain's response to kissing might reveal whether there are instinctive, neurological reactions to kissing that transcend cultural conditioning, such as the release of hormones like oxytocin, which is associated with bonding and affection.

2. **Evolutionary Perspectives:**
   - From an evolutionary standpoint, kissing could be examined for potential advantages it might have offered in terms of mate selection, bonding, or genetic assessment. The theory that kissing helps individuals assess the genetic compatibility of potential mates through taste or smell has been proposed.
   - The role of kissing in facilitating emotional bonds and cooperation among humans, traits that could have evolutionary benefits in terms of survival and raising offspring, is also worth considering.

3. **Cultural Variability:**
   - A comprehensive look at different cultures can reveal the extent to which kissing is a universal behavior. While many cultures have traditions of romantic or affectionate kissing, there are also societies where kissing is not practiced or is even considered taboo.
   - Understanding the historical emergence of kissing in various cultures could shed light on whether it is a naturally occurring behavior that was adopted independently across different societies or if its spread was due to cultural diffusion.

4. **Psychological and Social Functions:**
   - Exploring the psychological impact of kissing on individuals, such as its role in enhancing emotional intimacy, trust, and well-being, can provide insights into why kissing has become a valued expression of affection in many cultures.
   - The social functions of kissing, including its use as a greeting, a sign of respect, or a ritualistic practice, suggest that its meanings are diverse and heavily influenced by cultural norms and values.

**Conclusion:**

Kissing, in its various forms, appears to have both biological and sociological components. There is evidence to suggest that it can be an instinctive behavior with evolutionary advantages, such as bonding and mate assessment. However, the wide cultural variability and the diverse meanings and practices associated with kissing also indicate that social constructs play a significant role in how kissing is perceived and practiced.

The question of whether kissing is instinctively erotic is more complex. While it can be an expression of sexual desire and intimacy in many contexts, kissing also serves non-erotic purposes, such as greeting or showing affection among family members, which points to its multifaceted nature.

Ultimately, kissing can be seen as a natural human activity with deep biological roots that has been shaped and enriched by cultural practices and social meanings. Its significance and expression are influenced by a blend of innate human instincts and the diverse cultural landscapes in which humans live.

> History[edit]<br>Anthropologists disagree on whether kissing is an instinctual or learned behaviour. Those who believe kissing to be an instinctual behaviour cite similar behaviours in other animals such as bonobos, which are known to kiss after fighting - possibly to restore peace. Others believe that it is a learned behaviour, having evolved from activities such as suckling or premastication in early human cultures passed on to modern humans. Another theory posits that the practice originated in males during the paleolithic era tasting the saliva of females to test their health in order to determine whether they would make a good partner
