## Original Question

*What types of light can't a plant photosynthesize in?
I have a plant on my desk, and it got me to wondering: Can my plant use the light from my monitors to photosynthesize? If so, what light (apart from green light, to a degree) can't plants use to perform photosynthesis?
I know that plants have the photosynthetic pigments to absorb many different wavelengths of light (primarily red and blue) but would there be certain types of light it can't use?
(The specific plant by the way is Schlumbergera truncata)*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here revolves around understanding which types of light are ineffective or less efficient for plant photosynthesis, specifically for Schlumbergera truncata (also known as the Christmas Cactus), and whether the light emitted from monitors can support the photosynthesis process in plants.

1. **Understanding Photosynthesis and Light Requirements:**
   Photosynthesis in plants involves converting light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in sugars. This process primarily relies on chlorophyll, the pigment that gives plants their green color. Chlorophyll absorbs light most efficiently in the red and blue parts of the spectrum and less efficiently in other parts, such as the green part of the spectrum, which is why plants appear green to us.

2. **Types of Light Plants Use:**
   - **Blue Light (400-500 nm):** Essential for leaf growth and strong stem development. It's also crucial for opening the stomata, which are small openings on the leaves for gas exchange.
   - **Red Light (600-700 nm):** Promotes flowering and fruit production and is vital for the photosynthesis process.
   
3. **Types of Light Plants Struggle to Use or Can't Use:**
   - **Green Light (500-600 nm):** Plants reflect rather than absorb most green light, which is why they appear green. However, some studies suggest that green light can penetrate deeper into the leaf interior and could be used in photosynthesis, albeit less efficiently.
   - **Far-Red and Infrared (>700 nm):** These wavelengths are too long for efficient photosynthesis. While far-red light can influence some plant behaviors (like flowering and seed germination), it is not directly used in the photosynthesis process.
   - **Ultraviolet (UV) Light (<400 nm):** UV light is harmful to plants and can cause damage to DNA and other cellular structures, although some plants have adapted to use a fraction of UV light for protective functions rather than for photosynthesis.

4. **Light from Monitors:**
   - The light emitted from computer monitors is primarily designed for human vision and not for photosynthesis. Monitors typically emit light in the visible spectrum with peaks in the blue and green regions, and very little in the red region. While there may be some photosynthetic activity triggered by the blue light from the monitor, it's unlikely to be sufficient for normal plant growth and development, especially for Schlumbergera truncata.
   - Schlumbergera truncata, being a tropical forest cactus, is adapted to bright, indirect light rather than the direct sunlight. It thrives under light conditions that mimic the dappled sunlight of its natural habitat. The light from a monitor is much less intense than natural sunlight and lacks the full spectrum required for optimal photosynthesis and growth.

5. **Conclusion:**
   While the light from your monitors might contribute slightly to photosynthesis, particularly through the blue light, it's not enough to sustain a plant like Schlumbergera truncata in the long term. Plants can't effectively use green light for photosynthesis, and light sources lacking in red wavelengths are not ideal. For healthy growth, it's recommended to supplement with natural light or use artificial grow lights designed to emit the specific wavelengths plants need for photosynthesis.

These centres are named after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them.<br>The function of the reaction center of chlorophyll is to absorb light energy and transfer it to other parts of the photosystem. The absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation. The removal of the electron from the chlorophyll is an oxidation reaction. The chlorophyll donates the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediates called an electron transport chain. The charged reaction center of chlorophyll (P680) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water. The electron that reduces P680 ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O2 and H through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O2 gas, and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700 of Photosystem I is usually reduced as it accepts the electron, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons coming, ultimately, from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700 can vary.<br>The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to pump H ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a proton-motive force a chemiosmotic potential used mainly in the production of ATP (stored chemical energy) or to reduce NADP to NADPH. NADPH is a universal agent used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as other biosynthetic reactions.<br>Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other chlorophyll pigments, but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small. Thus, the other chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment proteins all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll a, there are other pigments, called accessory pigments, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.
