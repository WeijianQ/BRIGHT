# Query `15`

## Original Question

*Can a bacterium infect another bacterium?
I researched about it by searching on Google and reading some bacteriological articles, but I did not get any answer. I also asked some of my teachers, and they were also a bit confused. Some said that it is possible and others said not. So the question remains:
Can a bacterium infect another bacterium? If so, how?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is determining whether a bacterium can infect another bacterium, and if so, how this process occurs. This question probes into the interactions between microscopic organisms, particularly focusing on the concept of "infection" in a context that is not typically discussed in basic biology, where infection usually refers to bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens infecting multicellular organisms, not other single-celled organisms like themselves.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding 'Infection':** Firstly, we need to clarify what we mean by "infection." Typically, infection refers to the process by which a pathogen enters, and sometimes replicates within, a host organism, causing disease. When considering bacteria infecting other bacteria, we're looking at a scenario where one bacterium acts as a pathogen to another, which is unconventional in common parlance but not out of the realm of possibility.

2. **Bacterial Interactions:** Bacteria interact with each other and their environment in various ways, including competition, cooperation (e.g., biofilm formation), and predation. These interactions suggest a complex web of relationships where one bacterium could potentially harm another, either directly or indirectly.

3. **Known Mechanisms of Inter-Bacterial Harm:** 
   - **Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs):** These are predatory bacteria that prey on other bacteria. While not a traditional infection, BALOs invade, grow inside, and kill their bacterial prey, which is somewhat analogous to infection.
   - **Bacteriophages (Phages):** While phages are viruses that infect bacteria, not bacteria themselves, their existence and role in bacterial dynamics illustrate that bacteria can be "infected" or attacked by other microscopic entities. This is relevant because it demonstrates the principle that bacteria can be susceptible to invasion and destruction by entities other than multicellular organisms' immune systems.
   - **Genetic Elements:** Elements such as plasmids, transposons, and genomic islands can be transferred between bacteria through processes like conjugation, transformation, and transduction. Some of these elements can carry genes that might be harmful to the recipient bacterium, akin to a form of infection.

4. **Direct Bacterial Infection:** The concept of a bacterium directly infecting another in a manner similar to how viruses infect cells is less documented but possible in theory. For instance, research into the microbiome and bacterial interactions has unveiled complex behaviors and mechanisms that could support such processes. However, specific mechanisms or examples of direct bacterial infection (one bacterium entering and replicating within another) are rare and not widely recognized in scientific literature as of my last update.

### Conclusion

While the traditional concept of infection, as understood in virology or bacteriology regarding multicellular hosts, might not directly apply, bacteria can indeed engage in interactions that are analogous to infection. Predatory bacteria and the transfer of harmful genetic elements represent the closest parallels to one bacterium "infecting" another. Direct infection, in the sense of one bacterium entering and replicating inside another, is less documented and would require more specific examples to fully validate.

The confusion among teachers and the lack of clear answers in your research likely stem from the unconventional use of "infection" in this context and the relatively sparse research on direct bacterial-bacterial infection mechanisms. The microbial world is complex and continually reveals new interactions and behaviors, so what is not widely recognized today may become better understood in the future.

> Culture conditions[edit]<br>B. bacteriovorus appears to be ubiquitous in nature and manmade habitats. They have been found in soil samples, rhizosphere of plant roots, rivers, oceans, sewage, intestines and feces of birds and mammals, and even in oyster shells and the gills of crabs. B. bacteriovorus are able to thrive in almost any habitat, the general requirements are that there needs to be oxygen and some other Gram-negative bacteria present in its environment. Its optimal temperature is between 28-30°C, making B. bacteriovorus a mesophile. Bdellovibrio is grown in the laboratory in its stationary HI (host-independent) phase at 29°C on yeast peptone broth agar. Host-dependent (predatory) cultures are grown with a population of E. coli S-17 at 29°C for 16 hrs. They may also be cultured using YPSC (yeast extract, peptone, sodium acetate, calcium chloride) overlays or prey lysates.

> Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus[edit]<br>The most well studied of these is Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, which is found almost exclusively in host dependent growth in nature. In this free swimming attack form after searching for prey using its pili, it burrows through the host outer membrane/ peptidoglycan cell wall and enters the periplasmic space. The Bdellovibrio bacterium then forms a structure called a bdelloplast. This bdelloplast is created as the host cell is modified to become spherical in shape. Inside the bdelloplast, the singular large flagellum of the predatory Bdellovibrio is lost. The host cell is then rapidly killed allowing the passage of molecules from the interior of the host cytoplasm through to the periplasm freely, and the periplasm dwelling Bdellovibrio to feed. Using some of these molecules the Bdellovibrio creates a protective environment by reinforcing the peptidoglycan cell wall of the host in which it now dwells using amidases and transpeptidases. After around 4hrs, depending on ambient temperature, the Bdellovibrio has increased in size dramatically through this nourishment. It divides to replicate and then leaves via a final lysis of the host's cell wall and membranes. The newly emerging Bdellovibrio use their newly grown powerful flagella to swim away and find the next suitable host. Because of this intermittent bdelloplast stage, and momentary parasitic phase (15-20 mins), Bdellovibrio could be considered bacterial predators or parasites.<br>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus was first described by Stolp and Petzold in 1962. In 2012 another member of the Bdellovibrio species was identified "Bdellovibrio tiberius" of the River tiber.

Bdellovibrio show up as a growing clear plaque in an E. coli “lawn”. Notably, Bdellovibrio has a sheath that covers its flagellum – a rare feature for bacteria.

> Life cycle and parasitism[edit]<br>Bdellovibrio life cycle. The Bdellovibrio attaches to a Gram-negative bacterium after contact, and penetrates into the prey's periplasmic space. Once inside, elongation occurs and progeny cells are released within 4 hours.<br>Bdellovibrio cells can swim as fast as 160 µm/s, or over 100 times their body-length per second. It swims using a single sheathed polar flagellum with a characteristic dampened filament waveform. Bdellovibrio attacks other Gram-negative bacteria by attaching itself to the prey cell's outer membrane and peptidoglycan layer, after which it creates a small hole in the outer membrane. The Bdellovibrio cell then enters the host periplasmic space. It remains reversibly attached to it for a short "recognition" period.<br>After the recognition period, it becomes irreversibly attached via the pole opposite the flagellum. Once inside the periplasm, the Bdellovibrio cell seals the membrane hole and converts the host cell to a spherical morphology, this is due to secretion of L,D transpeptidases which breaks the peptidoglycan apart, and therefore causes the cell to become amorphous. The two-cell complex formed is called a bdelloplast. The Bdellovibrio cell uses hydrolytic enzymes to break down the host cell molecules, which it uses to grow filamentously. When the host cell nutrients are exhausted, the filament septates to form progeny Bdellovibrios. The progeny become motile before they lyse the host cell and are released into the environment. The entire life cycle takes three to four hours, and produces an average of 3–6 progeny cells from a single E. coli, or up to 90 from larger prey such as filamentous E. coli.<br>Targets of Bdellovibrio species, including Vibrio vulnificus, may undergo co-infection by Bdellovibrio and bacteriophage. Although the Bdellovibrio rounding of prey is thought to be evolved to reduce co-infection of multiple Bdellovibrio, larger prey that do not round may be infected by multiple Bdello's.

> Bdellovibrio is a genus of Gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacteria.  One of the more notable characteristics of this genus is that members can prey upon other Gram-negative bacteria and feed on the biopolymers, e.g. proteins and nucleic acids, of their hosts. They have two lifestyles: a host-dependent, highly mobile phase, the "attack phase", in which they form "bdelloplasts" in their host bacteria; and a slow-growing, irregularly shaped, host-independent form.
