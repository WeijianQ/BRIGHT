## Original Question

*Can plants get cancer?
I can't think of any reason why plants wouldn't be able to get cancer, but I've never heard of a plant growing a tumor. I've also never seen a plant with a noticeable abnormal growth. Can plants get cancer?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're asking about is whether plants can get cancer, similar to animals and humans. This is an intriguing question because it touches on the biological processes of plants and how they differ from those of animals. To address this question, let's break it down step by step, considering what cancer is, how it forms, and then how these concepts apply to plants.

1. **Understanding Cancer**: At its core, cancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells. In animals, these cells can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body (metastasis), causing damage and, in many cases, leading to death if not treated. Cancer arises due to mutations in genes that regulate cell growth and division.

2. **Plant Cell Structure and Growth**: Plants, like animals, are made up of cells that divide and grow. However, plant cells have some key differences, such as a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, which provides structural support. This cell wall restricts the mobility of plant cells, which is one reason why plants don't show cancerous growths in the same way animals do. Additionally, plant cells have a more fixed structure and organization within tissues, limiting the potential for the kind of uncontrolled growth seen in animal cancers.

3. **Plant Growth and Damage Response**: Plants grow differently than animals. Their growth is largely limited to specific regions called meristems (located at the tips of roots and shoots), where cells actively divide. When a plant is damaged or subjected to stress (including genetic mutations that might lead to cancer in animals), it often responds by activating these meristem areas to repair the damage or replace lost tissue, rather than allowing uncontrolled cell growth throughout the body.

4. **Plant Tumors and Galls**: While plants may not get "cancer" in the same way animals do, they can develop growths or tumors. These are usually the result of external factors, such as infection by certain bacteria (e.g., Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes crown gall disease), viruses, or parasites, rather than internal genetic mutations leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. These growths are localized and do not metastasize like animal cancers because plant cells are largely immobile.

5. **Conclusion**: In summary, while plants can experience uncontrolled cell growth that might superficially resemble cancer, the rigid structure of plant cells, their fixed growth patterns, and the inability of plant cells to move and invade other tissues mean that plants do not get cancer in the same way animals do. The growth abnormalities seen in plants are usually due to external infections or damage and are more accurately referred to as tumors or galls rather than cancer.

> General mechanism[edit]<br>Transmissible cancers require a specific combination of related circumstances to occur. These conditions involve both the host species and the tumors being transferred. These typically include, low genetic diversity among individuals, effective physical and environmental transport system, effective dose of infective material and ideal micro-environments.  The cancers reproduce faster in larger quantities with different means of reproduction tend to be favored for transmission if host conditions are met. Transmissible cancers follow the general pattern of cancer spread, starting with the growth of primary cancer cells at tumor sites  followed by invasion of surrounding tissue and subsequent spread throughout the organism. The main hurdles for surviving cells of a successful spread to a new host are histocompatibility barriers. The cancers have to bypass the self recognition system, survive the difference in nutrients and induce the correct response in the new hosts to begin the cycle anew.<br>Transmissible cancers behave as true parasites, relying primarily on transport systems like direct contact, environmental transport and vectors, rather than hematogenous and lymphatic carriers to spread between organisms. The amount of shredded cancer cells from initial host has to be high enough to increase survival probability. Direct contact transmissions through sexual or general contact such as in DFTD and CVTD ensures a higher potential for transmission. Population factors also play an important role. A dense population of available and uninfected potential hosts is ideal for the tumors given the complexity and difficulty of the overall process, hence its virulence and potency must be adequately controlled.

The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells. Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall. Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in

> Disease cycle[edit]<br>Disease cycle<br>Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live predominantly saprophytic lifestyles, so its common even for plant-parasitic species of this genus to survive in the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA into the plant's genome. See above for more details about the process of plasmid DNA insertion into the host genome. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads to gall formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes this tissue to become crushed and/or distorted. The crushed vessels lead to reduced water flow in the xylem. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes the breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.

> Infection methods[edit]<br>Agrobacterium tumefaciens infects the plant through its Ti plasmid. The Ti plasmid integrates a segment of its DNA, known as T-DNA, into the chromosomal DNA of its host plant cells. A. tumefaciens has flagella that allow it to swim through the soil towards photoassimilates that accumulate in the rhizosphere around roots. Some strains may chemotactically move towards chemical exudates from plants, such as acetosyringone and sugars, which indicate the presence of a wound in the plant through which the bacteria may enter. Phenolic compounds are recognised by the VirA protein, a transmembrane protein encoded in the virA gene on the Ti plasmid. Sugars are recognised by the chvE protein, a chromosomal gene-encoded protein located in the periplasmic space.<br>At least 25 vir genes on the Ti plasmid are necessary for tumor induction. In addition to their perception role, virA and chvE induce other vir genes. The VirA protein has autokinase activity: it phosphorylates itself on a histidine residue. Then the VirA protein phosphorylates the VirG protein on its aspartate residue. The virG protein is a cytoplasmic protein produced from the virG Ti plasmid gene. It is a transcription factor, inducing the transcription of the vir operons. The ChvE protein regulates the second mechanism of the vir genes' activation. It increases VirA protein sensitivity to phenolic compounds.<br>Attachment is a two-step process. Following an initial weak and reversible attachment, the bacteria synthesize cellulose fibrils that anchor them to the wounded plant cell to which they were attracted. Four main genes are involved in this process: chvA, chvB, pscA, and att. The products of the first three genes apparently are involved in the actual synthesis of the cellulose fibrils. These fibrils also anchor the bacteria to each other, helping to form a microcolony.<br>VirC, the most important virulent protein, is a necessary step in the recombination of illegitimate recolonization. It selects the section of the DNA in the host plant that will be replaced and it cuts into this strand of DNA.<br>After production of cellulose fibrils, a calcium-dependent outer membrane protein called rhicadhesin is produced, which also aids in sticking the bacteria to the cell wall. Homologues of this protein can be found in other rhizobia. Currently, there are several reports on standardisation of protocol for the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The effect of different parameters such as infection time, acetosyringone, DTT, and cysteine have been studied in soybean (Glycine max).<br>Possible plant compounds that initiate Agrobacterium to infect plant cells:<br>Acetosyringone and other phenolic compounds<br>alpha-Hydroxyacetosyringone<br>Catechol<br>Ferulic acid<br>Gallic acid<br>p-Hydroxybenzoic acid<br>Protocatechuic acid<br>Pyrogallic acid<br>Resorcylic acid<br>Sinapinic acid<br>Syringic acid<br>Vanillin<br>Formation of the T-pilus[edit]<br>To transfer T-DNA into a plant cell, A. tumefaciens uses a type IV secretion mechanism, involving the production of a T-pilus. When acetosyringone and other substances are detected, a signal transduction event activates the expression of 11 genes within the VirB operon which are responsible for the formation of the T-pilus.<br>The pro-pilin is formed first. This is a polypeptide of 121 amino acids which requires processing by the removal of 47 residues to form a T-pilus subunit. The subunit was thought to be circularized by the formation of a peptide bond between the two ends of the polypeptide. However, high-resolution structure of the T-pilus revealed no cyclization of the pilin, with the overall organization of the pilin subunits being highly similar to those of other conjugative pili, such as F-pilus.<br>Products of the other VirB genes are used to transfer the subunits across the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid studies provide evidence that VirB6, VirB7, VirB8, VirB9 and VirB10 may all encode components of the transporter. An ATPase for the active transport of the subunits would also be required.<br>Transfer of T-DNA into the plant cell[edit]<br>Agrobacterium cellAgrobacterium chromosomeTi Plasmid (a.

This is typically done by the Vir genes within the helper plasmid. A VirD1/D2 complex nicks the DNA at the left and right border sequences. The VirD2 protein is covalently attached to the 5' end. VirD2 contains a motif that leads to the nucleoprotein complex being targeted to the type IV secretion system (T4SS). The structure of the T-pilus showed that the central channel of the pilus is too narrow to allow the transfer of the folded VirD2, suggesting that VirD2 must be partially unfolded during the conjugation process.<br>In the cytoplasm of the recipient cell, the T-DNA complex becomes coated with VirE2 proteins, which are exported through the T4SS independently from the T-DNA complex.<br>Nuclear localization signals, or NLSs, located on the VirE2 and VirD2, are recognised by the importin alpha protein, which then associates with importin beta and the nuclear pore complex to transfer the T-DNA into the nucleus. VIP1 also appears to be an important protein in the process, possibly acting as an adapter to bring the VirE2 to the importin. Once inside the nucleus, VIP2 may target the T-DNA to areas of chromatin that are being actively transcribed, so that the T-DNA can integrate into the host genome.

> Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the causal agent of crown gall disease (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium. Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis), from a plasmid into the plant cell, which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors.<br>Agrobacterium tumefaciens is an Alphaproteobacterium of the family Rhizobiaceae, which includes the nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts. Unlike the nitrogen-fixing symbionts, tumor-producing Agrobacterium species are pathogenic and do not benefit the plant. The wide variety of plants affected by Agrobacterium makes it of great concern to the agriculture industry.<br>Economically, A. tumefaciens is a serious pathogen of walnuts, grape vines, stone fruits, nut trees, sugar beets, horse radish, and rhubarb, and the persistent nature of the tumors or galls caused by the disease make it particularly harmful for perennial crops.<br>Agrobacterium tumefaciens grows optimally at 28 °C (82 °F). The doubling time can range from 2.5–4h depending on the media, culture format, and level of aeration. At temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F), A. tumefaciens begins to experience heat shock which is likely to result in errors in cell division.
