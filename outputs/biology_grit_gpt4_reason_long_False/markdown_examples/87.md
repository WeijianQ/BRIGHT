## Original Question

*Below which temperature human muscles don't work?
When one exposes theirs body parts to cold environment (especially foot and hands), they may be numb, with temporarily blocked both muscles.
What is typical body temperature below which human muscles don't work properly?
Moreover, what is the mechanism behind it?
EDIT:
Interested in case when muscles almost cease to work (e.g one is not able to grasp a cup), not just in small perturbations to strength.*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is understanding the temperature threshold below which human muscles cease to function properly, especially in situations where exposure to cold makes it difficult or impossible to perform tasks like grasping a cup. This involves looking into the typical body temperature at which muscles don't work optimally and the underlying mechanisms causing this impairment.

1. **Temperature Threshold for Muscle Function**:
   - Human muscles are designed to operate within a relatively narrow temperature range. The core body temperature of a healthy human typically ranges around 37°C (98.6°F). However, the extremities (like hands and feet) can experience a wider range of temperatures due to environmental conditions.
   - There isn't a universally agreed-upon "exact" temperature below which muscles stop working entirely because it can vary based on individual health, acclimatization levels, and specific circumstances. However, muscle function can start to significantly deteriorate at or below 10°C (50°F) when exposed to cold without proper protection. This deterioration accelerates as temperatures drop further.
   
2. **Mechanisms Behind Impaired Muscle Function in Cold**:
   - **Reduced Blood Flow**: Cold exposure causes vasoconstriction, a narrowing of blood vessels, which reduces blood flow to extremities to preserve core body temperature. This reduced blood flow limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to muscles, impairing their function.
   - **Altered Nerve Function**: Cold temperatures can slow nerve conduction, making the communication between the brain and muscles less efficient. This can result in delayed or weakened muscle responses.
   - **Energy Supply Disruption**: Muscles require ATP (adenosine triphosphate) for contraction. Cold environments can interfere with metabolic processes that produce ATP, thus reducing energy supply to muscles.
   - **Increased Viscosity**: Cold can increase the viscosity of synovial fluid in joints, making movement stiffer and more difficult. It also affects the elasticity of muscle fibers, making them less responsive.
   - **Direct Effect on Muscle Fibers**: Extremely low temperatures can directly affect the muscle fibers' ability to contract. The biochemical processes that facilitate muscle contraction are temperature-sensitive and can be less efficient or even halted in cold conditions.

3. **Impact on Muscle Function**:
   - As temperatures fall below the threshold where these mechanisms come into significant play, individuals may find it increasingly difficult to perform tasks requiring fine motor skills, such as grasping a cup. In extreme cases, muscle control can be so compromised that voluntary movement is severely limited or impossible.
   - The effect is most pronounced in the extremities, which are furthest from the core and thus most susceptible to reduced blood flow and temperature drops. The body prioritizes protecting core temperature to safeguard vital organs, sometimes at the expense of limb function.

In summary, while there isn't a single temperature at which all human muscles will cease to function, exposure to cold environments can lead to a significant reduction in muscle performance, particularly below 10°C (50°F). The mechanisms behind this include reduced blood flow, altered nerve function, disruptions in energy supply, increased viscosity affecting movement, and direct impacts on muscle fiber contraction. These factors collectively contribute to the inability to perform tasks requiring muscle coordination and strength in cold conditions.

> Shivering (also called shuddering) is a bodily function in response to cold and extreme fear in warm-blooded animals. When the core body temperature drops, the shivering reflex is triggered to maintain homeostasis. Skeletal muscles begin to shake in small movements, creating warmth by expending energy. Shivering can also be a response to fever, as a person may feel cold. During fever, the hypothalamic set point for temperature is raised. The increased set point causes the body temperature to rise (pyrexia), but also makes the patient feel cold until the new set point is reached. Severe chills with violent shivering are called rigors. Rigors occur because the patient's body is shivering in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point.

> Biological basis[edit]<br>Located in the posterior hypothalamus near the wall of the third ventricle is an area called the primary motor center for shivering. This area is normally inhibited by signals from the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area but is excited by cold signals from the skin and spinal cord.  Therefore, this center becomes activated when the body temperature falls even a fraction of a degree below a critical temperature level.<br>Increased muscular activity results in the generation of heat as a byproduct.  Most often, when the purpose of the muscle activity is to produce motion, the heat is wasted energy. In shivering, the heat is the main intended product and is utilized for warmth.<br>Newborn babies, infants, and young children experience a greater (net) heat loss than adults because of greater surface-area-to-volume ratio. As they cannot shiver to maintain body heat, they rely on non-shivering thermogenesis.  Children have an increased amount of brown adipose tissue (increased vascular supply, and high mitochondrial density), and, when cold-stressed, will have greater oxygen consumption and will release norepinephrine. Norepinephrine will react with lipases in brown fat to break down fat into triglycerides. Triglycerides are then metabolized to glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids. These are then further degraded in the needed heat-generating process to form CO2 and water. Chemically, in mitochondria, the proton gradient producing the proton electromotive force that is ordinarily used to synthesize ATP is instead bypassed to produce heat directly.<br>Shivering can also appear after surgery. This is known as postanesthetic shivering.<br>In humans, shivering can also be caused by mere cognition. This is known as psychogenic shivering.
