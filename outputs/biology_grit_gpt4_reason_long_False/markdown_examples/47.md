# Query `47`

## Original Question

*How do ants follow each other?
I was observing ants in my house.They all were going in a straight line and also some of the ants were coming back through the the same line.
I took some water and rubbed the line with my finger, then the ants were not able to follow each other. Looks like they were confused.
My assumption is that they may had secreted some chemical .
Am I right ? If yes, then which chemical is that and how it is secreted?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're observing involves understanding how ants navigate and follow each other, particularly in a scenario where their path is disrupted by water. Your observations and questions point towards the mechanisms ants use for trail following and what happens when those mechanisms are interrupted.

**Step 1: Understanding Ant Trail Behavior**

Ants are social insects that live in colonies. One of their key behaviors for finding food and guiding other ants to it involves laying down a chemical trail. This behavior is crucial for the survival of the colony, as it helps ants efficiently gather resources and communicate with each other.

**Step 2: The Role of Pheromones**

The chemical you're asking about is known as a pheromone. Pheromones are chemical substances produced and released into the environment by animals, affecting the behavior or physiology of others of its species. In the case of ants, when a forager ant finds food, it will return to the nest, laying down a trail of pheromones. Other ants in the colony detect this trail with their antennae and follow it to the food source. As more ants travel back and forth along the trail, they reinforce it with additional pheromones, making it stronger and attracting more ants.

**Step 3: Secretion of Pheromones**

The pheromones are secreted through special glands. In ants, these glands are located in various parts of their bodies, such as the abdomen. The exact gland and its location can vary among different ant species. The pheromone secretion is a controlled process, with ants releasing more or less of it depending on the need for trail reinforcement or the urgency of communicating the food source's location to the rest of the colony.

**Step 4: Disruption of the Chemical Trail**

When you rubbed the ant trail with water, you effectively removed or diluted the pheromone trail. Without this chemical guide, the ants became disoriented and unable to follow the original path. This disruption showcases the reliance of ants on these chemical cues for navigation and communication. Ants can eventually re-establish a path by laying down a new pheromone trail, but this requires time and effort from the foraging ants.

**Step 5: Re-establishment of the Trail**

After the disruption, scout ants may venture out again to find the food source. Upon rediscovering it, they will lay down a new pheromone trail, guiding the rest of the colony once more. This process highlights the adaptability and resilience of ant colonies in the face of challenges to their foraging paths.

In summary, ants follow each other and navigate by following pheromone trails laid down by scout ants. These pheromones are secreted from special glands and are crucial for the ants' collective foraging strategy. When these trails are disrupted, as in your experiment with water, it temporarily confuses the ants until they can lay down a new trail.

> Categorization by function[edit]<br>Aggregation[edit]<br>Aggregation of bug nymphs<br>Aggregation of the water springtail Podura aquatica<br>Aggregation pheromones function in mate choice, overcoming host resistance by mass attack, and defense against predators. A group of individuals at one location is referred to as an aggregation, whether consisting of one sex or both sexes. Male-produced sex attractants have been called aggregation pheromones, because they usually result in the arrival of both sexes at a calling site and increase the density of conspecifics surrounding the pheromone source. Most sex pheromones are produced by the females; only a small percentage of sex attractants are produced by males. Aggregation pheromones have been found in members of the Coleoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Hemiptera, Dictyoptera, and Orthoptera. In recent decades, aggregation pheromones have proven useful in the management of many pests, such as the boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), the pea and bean weevil (Sitona lineatus, and stored product weevils (e.g. Sitophilus zeamais, Sitophilus granarius, and Sitophilus oryzae). Aggregation pheromones are among the most ecologically selective pest suppression methods. They are non-toxic and effective at very low concentrations.<br>Alarm[edit]<br><br>Main article: Alarm signal<br>Some species release a volatile substance when attacked by a predator that can trigger flight (in aphids) or aggression (in ants, bees, termites, and wasps) in members of the same species. For example, Vespula squamosa use alarm pheromones to alert others to a threat. In Polistes exclamans, alarm pheromones are also used as an alert to incoming predators. Pheromones also exist in plants: Certain plants emit alarm pheromones when grazed upon, resulting in tannin production in neighboring plants. These tannins make the plants less appetizing to herbivores.<br>An alarm pheromone has been documented in a mammalian species. Alarmed pronghorn, Antilocapra americana flair their white rump hair and exposes two highly odoriferous glands that releases a compound described having the odor "reminiscent of buttered popcorn". This sends a message to other pronghorns by both sight and smell about a present danger. This scent has been observed by humans 20 to 30 meters downwind from alarmed animals. The major odour compound identified from this gland is 2-pyrrolidinone.<br>Epideictic[edit]<br>Epideictic pheromones are different from territory pheromones, when it comes to insects. Fabre observed and noted how "females who lay their eggs in these fruits deposit these mysterious substances in the vicinity of their clutch to signal to other females of the same species they should clutch elsewhere." It may be helpful to note that the word epideictic, having to do with display or show (from the Greek 'deixis'), has a different but related meaning in rhetoric, the human art of persuasion by means of words.<br>Territorial[edit]<br>Laid down in the environment, territorial pheromones mark the boundaries and identity of an organism's territory. In cats and dogs, these hormones are present in the urine, which they deposit on landmarks serving to mark the perimeter of the claimed territory. In social seabirds, the preen gland is used to mark nests, nuptial gifts, and territory boundaries with behavior formerly described as 'displacement activity'.<br>Trail[edit]<br><br>Main article: Trail pheromone<br>Social insects commonly use trail pheromones. For example, ants mark their paths with pheromones consisting of volatile hydrocarbons. Certain ants lay down an initial trail of pheromones as they return to the nest with food. This trail attracts other ants and serves as a guide. As long as the food source remains available, visiting ants will continuously renew the pheromone trail. The pheromone requires continuous renewal because it evaporates quickly. When the food supply begins to dwindle, the trail-making ceases. Pharaoh ants (Monomorium pharaonis) mark trails that no longer lead to food with a repellent pheromone, which causes avoidance behaviour in ants.<br>Repellent trail markers may help ants to undertake more efficient collective exploration. <br>The army ant Eciton burchellii provides an example of using pheromones to mark and maintain foraging paths. When species of wasps such as Polybia sericea found new nests, they use pheromones to lead the rest of the colony to the new nesting site.<br>Gregarious caterpillars, such as the forest tent caterpillar, lay down pheromone trails that are used to achieve group movement.<br>Sex[edit]<br><br>Main article: Sex pheromone<br>Male Danaus chrysippus showing the pheromone pouch and brush-like organ in Kerala, India<br>In animals, sex pheromones indicate the availability of the female for breeding. Male animals may also emit pheromones that convey information about their species and genotype.<br>At the microscopic level, a number of bacterial species (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus) release specific chemicals into the surrounding media to induce the "competent" state in neighboring bacteria. Competence is a physiological state that allows bacterial cells to take up DNA from other cells and incorporate this DNA into their own genome, a sexual process called transformation.<br>Among eukaryotic microorganisms, pheromones promote sexual interaction in numerous species. These species include the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa and Mucor mucedo, the water mold Achlya ambisexualis, the aquatic fungus Allomyces macrogynus, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, the ciliate protozoan Blepharisma japonicum and the multicellular green algae Volvox carteri. In addition, male copepods can follow a three-dimensional pheromone trail left by a swimming female, and male gametes of many animals use a pheromone to help find a female gamete for fertilization.<br>Many well-studied insect species, such as the ant Leptothorax acervorum, the moths Helicoverpa zea and Agrotis ipsilon, the bee Xylocopa sonorina,  the frog Pseudophryne bibronii, and the butterfly Edith's checkerspot release sex pheromones to attract a mate, and some lepidopterans (moths and butterflies) can detect a potential mate from as far away as 10 km (6.2 mi). Some insects, such as ghost moths, use pheromones during lek mating. Traps containing pheromones are used by farmers to detect and monitor insect populations in orchards. In addition, Colias eurytheme butterflies release pheromones, an olfactory cue important for mate selection.<br>The effect of Hz-2V virus infection on the reproductive physiology and behavior of female Helicoverpa zea moths is that in the absence of males they exhibited calling behavior and called as often but for shorter periods on average than control females. Even after these contacts virus-infected females made many frequent contacts with males and continued to call; they were found to produce five to seven times more pheromone and attracted twice as many males as did control females in flight tunnel experiments.<br>Pheromones are also utilized by bee and wasp species. Some pheromones can be used to suppress the sexual behavior of other individuals allowing for a reproductive monopoly – the wasp R. marginata uses this. With regard to the Bombus hyperboreus species, males, otherwise known as drones, patrol circuits of scent marks (pheromones) to find queens. In particular, pheromones for the Bombus hyperboreus, include octadecenol, 2,3-dihydro-6-transfarnesol, citronellol, and geranylcitronellol.<br>Sea urchins release pheromones into the surrounding water, sending a chemical message that triggers other urchins in the colony to eject their sex cells simultaneously.<br>In plants, some homosporous ferns release a chemical called antheridiogen, which affects sex expression.

> A pheromone (from Ancient Greek  φέρω (phérō) 'to bear', and  hormone) is a secreted or excreted chemical factor that triggers a social response in members of the same species. Pheromones are chemicals capable of acting like hormones outside the body of the secreting individual, to affect the behavior of the receiving individuals. There are alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, sex pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. Pheromones are used by many organisms, from basic unicellular prokaryotes to complex multicellular eukaryotes. Their use among insects has been particularly well documented. In addition, some vertebrates, plants and ciliates communicate by using pheromones. The ecological functions and evolution of pheromones are a major topic of research in the field of chemical ecology.

> Categorization by type[edit]<br>Releaser[edit]<br>Releaser pheromones are pheromones that cause an alteration in the behavior of the recipient. For example, some organisms use powerful attractant molecules to attract mates from a distance of two miles or more. In general, this type of pheromone elicits a rapid response, but is quickly degraded. In contrast, a primer pheromone has a slower onset and a longer duration. For example, rabbit (mothers) release mammary pheromones that trigger immediate nursing behavior by their babies.<br>Primer[edit]<br>Primer pheromones trigger a change of developmental events (in which they differ from all the other pheromones, which trigger a change in behavior).
