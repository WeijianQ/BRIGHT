## Original Question

*Why do adults lose hearing at high frequencies?
Children and teens can hear high pitched sounds that adults can't hear anymore. Why do adults lose high-frequency hearing?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is the phenomenon where adults tend to lose their ability to hear high-frequency sounds, a condition not as prevalent in children and teenagers. This condition is known as presbycusis or age-related hearing loss. To address this question, we will explore the anatomy of the ear, the process of hearing, factors contributing to hearing loss, and the specific reasons why high-frequency hearing diminishes with age.

1. **Anatomy of the Ear and the Process of Hearing**: Understanding how we hear is crucial. Sound waves enter the ear canal, causing the eardrum to vibrate. These vibrations are then transferred to the three small bones in the middle ear, which amplify the sound and transmit it to the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is filled with fluid and lined with thousands of tiny hair cells that move in response to the vibrations and convert them into electrical signals. These signals are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve, and the brain interprets them as sound. High-frequency sounds specifically stimulate the hair cells located at the base of the cochlea.

2. **Age-Related Changes in the Ear**: As people age, several changes can affect their hearing:
   - **Degeneration of Hair Cells**: The hair cells in the cochlea do not regenerate. Over time, exposure to loud noises, certain medications, and other factors can damage these cells, particularly those responsible for high-frequency sound detection. Since high-frequency sounds are processed by hair cells at the base of the cochlea, which are the first to encounter sound waves, they are also the first to be damaged over time.
   - **Changes in Cochlear Structures**: Aging can lead to changes in the structures of the inner ear, including stiffening of the basilar membrane where hair cells are located. This can affect how sound is transmitted and processed.
   - **Reduced Blood Flow**: Age can lead to reduced blood flow to the ear, affecting the health of auditory structures and contributing to hearing loss.
   - **Neural Degeneration**: Aging can also lead to a decline in the number of nerve fibers that transmit sound signals from the ear to the brain, affecting the clarity of hearing.

3. **Exposure to Loud Noises**: Long-term exposure to loud noises is a significant factor contributing to early onset of high-frequency hearing loss. This exposure can damage the hair cells responsible for detecting these frequencies more rapidly.

4. **Genetic Factors**: There may be a genetic predisposition to how susceptible individuals are to hearing loss, including the loss of high-frequency sounds.

5. **Preventive Measures and Treatment**: While age-related hearing loss is not entirely preventable, avoiding exposure to loud noises, using hearing protection, and maintaining overall health can slow its progression. Hearing aids and other assistive devices can help manage the condition.

In conclusion, adults lose high-frequency hearing primarily due to the natural aging process, which involves the degeneration of cochlear hair cells, changes in the structures of the inner ear, reduced blood flow, and neural degeneration. Exposure to loud noises and genetic factors can also contribute to the rate and extent of hearing loss. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to prevent and manage age-related high-frequency hearing loss.

> Causes[edit]<br><br>Main article: Causes of hearing loss<br>Hearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease.  For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as of unknown cause.<br>There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as presbycusis. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable, it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents. Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes, or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear. While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.<br>Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), also known as acoustic trauma, typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting). Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally. The majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure. Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards. Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. In the US, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using personal audio devices that are too loud. Hearing loss in adolescents may be caused by loud noise from toys, music by headphones, and concerts or events.<br>Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20–25% are inherited by dominant genes, 1–2% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance.  Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual, such as Usher syndrome, Stickler syndrome, Waardenburg syndrome, Alport's syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with the deafness in an individual.<br>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to alcoholic mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess alcohol intake. Premature birth can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of hypoxia, hyperbilirubinaemia, ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. Also, hearing loss in premature babies is often discovered far later than a similar hearing loss would be in a full-term baby because normally babies are given a hearing test within 48 hours of birth, but doctors must wait until the premature baby is medically stable before testing hearing, which can be months after birth. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500 g at birth.<br>Disorders responsible for hearing loss include auditory neuropathy, Down syndrome, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease variant 1E, autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, perilymph fistula, Ménière's disease, recurring ear infections, strokes, superior semicircular canal dehiscence, Pierre Robin, Treacher-Collins, Usher Syndrome, Pendred Syndrome, and Turner syndrome, syphilis, vestibular schwannoma, and viral infections such as measles, mumps, congenital rubella (also called German measles) syndrome, several varieties of herpes viruses, HIV/AIDS, and West Nile virus.<br>Some medications may reversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered ototoxic. This includes loop diuretics such as furosemide and bumetanide, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, quinine, and macrolide antibiotics. Others may cause permanent hearing loss. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and carboplatin.<br>In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as lead; solvents, such as toluene (found in crude oil, gasoline and automobile exhaust, for example); and asphyxiants. Combined with noise, these ototoxic chemicals have an additive effect on a person's hearing loss. Hearing loss due to chemicals starts in the high frequency range and is irreversible. It damages the cochlea with lesions and degrades central portions of the auditory system. For some ototoxic chemical exposures, particularly styrene, the risk of hearing loss can be higher than being exposed to noise alone. The effects is greatest when the combined exposure include impulse noise. A 2018 informational bulletin by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.<br>There can be damage either to the ear, whether the external or middle ear, to the cochlea, or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears.  Damage to the middle ear may include fracture and discontinuity of the ossicular chain.  Damage to the inner ear (cochlea) may be caused by temporal bone fracture.  People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.

> Presbycusis (also spelled presbyacusis, from Greek πρέσβυς presbys "old" + ἄκουσις akousis "hearing"), or age-related hearing loss, is the cumulative effect of aging on hearing. It is a progressive and irreversible bilateral symmetrical age-related sensorineural hearing loss resulting from degeneration of the cochlea or associated structures of the inner ear or auditory nerves. The hearing loss is most marked at higher frequencies. Hearing loss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging (nosocusis and sociocusis) is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of distinct causes of hearing loss can be difficult.<br>The cause of presbycusis is a combination of genetics, cumulative environmental exposures and pathophysiological changes related to aging. At present there are no preventive measures known; treatment is by hearing aid or surgical implant.<br>Presbycusis is the most common cause of hearing loss, affecting one out of three persons by age 65, and one out of two by age 75. Presbycusis is the second most common illness next to arthritis in aged people.<br>Many vertebrates such as fish, birds and amphibians do not experience presbycusis in old age as they are able to regenerate their cochlear sensory cells, whereas mammals including humans have genetically lost this regenerative ability.

In preindustrial and non-industrial societies, persons retain their hearing into old age.

> Diagnosis[edit]<br>Hearing loss is classified as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000 and 8000 Hz is traditionally used to classify the degree of hearing loss in each ear.  Normal hearing thresholds are considered to be 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical.  Mild hearing loss is thresholds of 25–45 dB; moderate hearing loss is thresholds of 45–65 dB; severe hearing loss is thresholds of 65–85 dB; and profound hearing loss thresholds are greater than 85 dB.<br>Tinnitus occurring in only one ear should prompt the clinician to initiate further evaluation for other etiologies.

The diagnosis of a sensorineural pattern hearing loss is made through audiometry, which shows a significant hearing loss without the "air-bone gap" that is characteristic of conductive hearing disturbances. In other words, air conduction is equal to bone conduction.
