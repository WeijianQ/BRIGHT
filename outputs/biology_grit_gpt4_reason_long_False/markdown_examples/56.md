## Original Question

*Why doesn't the cell membrane just...break apart?
Forgive me if this is a silly question. I can't understand the basics. Why doesn't the cell membrane just break apart? What's keeping the layers in the phospholipid bilayer together? I know that the membrane is embedded with proteins and lipids, but I still can't wrap my head around the "why". Are the hydrophobic interactions in the middle "stronger" than the hydrophilic interactions on the outside? What's keeping the individual phosphate heads together instead of, say, one of them just drifting away due to a nearby water molecule?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

Your question is a fundamental one in cell biology, touching on the stability and integrity of the cell membrane. The essential problem you're asking about is why the cell membrane, specifically the phospholipid bilayer that constitutes most of its structure, doesn't just disintegrate or break apart. This involves understanding the interactions that hold the membrane together and the nature of the molecules involved.

### 1. Structure of the Phospholipid Bilayer

First, let's consider the structure of the phospholipid bilayer. Phospholipids have a hydrophilic (water-attracting) "head" and two hydrophobic (water-repelling) "tails". In an aqueous environment, these molecules spontaneously arrange themselves so that the hydrophilic heads are facing the water on both the outside and inside of the cell, while the hydrophobic tails face each other, away from the water. This arrangement is energetically favorable, meaning it requires no additional energy to maintain.

### 2. Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions

To address your question about the strength of hydrophobic versus hydrophilic interactions: The driving force behind the formation and stability of the bilayer is not so much about the "strength" of these interactions but more about the thermodynamic favorability of minimizing the free energy of the system. Hydrophobic interactions among the tails inside the bilayer help to stabilize the membrane's structure by reducing the contact between the hydrophobic tails and the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, the hydrophilic heads interact with the water molecules outside and inside the cell, further stabilizing the membrane's structure. This arrangement reduces the system's overall free energy, making the bilayer a stable structure.

### 3. The Role of Embedded Proteins and Cholesterol

Embedded proteins and cholesterol molecules also play critical roles in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the cell membrane. Proteins can serve structural roles, act as channels or receptors, and contribute to the membrane's stability by their placement and interaction with the phospholipids. Cholesterol, on the other hand, inserts itself between phospholipid molecules, adding rigidity and flexibility to the membrane. This helps prevent the membrane from becoming too fluid or too rigid, further contributing to its stability.

### 4. The Stability of Phosphate Heads

Regarding your question about the phosphate heads drifting away: The heads are part of the phospholipid molecules and are not just loosely attached. They are chemically bonded to the glycerol backbone of the phospholipid, which in turn is bonded to the fatty acid tails. This covalent bonding ensures that the heads cannot simply drift away. Additionally, the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between the phosphate heads and surrounding water molecules contribute to the membrane's stability, rather than leading to its disintegration.

### Conclusion

In summary, the stability of the cell membrane is a result of the thermodynamically favorable arrangement of phospholipids in a bilayer, supported by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, and reinforced by embedded proteins and cholesterol. This sophisticated structure ensures that the cell membrane remains intact, flexible, and functional, rather than disintegrating in the aqueous environment in which cells exist.

> Examples[edit]<br>Pressure of an ideal gas[edit]<br>The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, and not on the volume of its containing box, so it is not an energy effect that tends to increase the volume of the box as gas pressure does. This implies that the pressure of an ideal gas has an entropic origin.<br>What is the origin of such an entropic force? The most general answer is that the effect of thermal fluctuations tends to bring a thermodynamic system toward a macroscopic state that corresponds to a maximum in the number of microscopic states (or micro-states) that are compatible with this macroscopic state. In other words, thermal fluctuations tend to bring a system toward its macroscopic state of maximum entropy.<br>Brownian motion[edit]<br>The entropic approach to Brownian movement was initially proposed by R. M. Neumann.  Neumann derived the entropic force for a particle undergoing three-dimensional Brownian motion using the Boltzmann equation, denoting this force as a diffusional driving force or radial force. In the paper, three example systems are shown to exhibit such a force:<br>electrostatic system of molten salt,<br>surface tension and,<br>elasticity of rubber.<br>Polymers[edit]<br>Main article: Ideal chain<br>A standard example of an entropic force is the elasticity of a freely jointed polymer molecule. For an ideal chain, maximizing its entropy means reducing the distance between its two free ends. Consequently, a force that tends to collapse the chain is exerted by the ideal chain between its two free ends. This entropic force is proportional to the distance between the two ends. The entropic force by a freely jointed chain has a clear mechanical origin and can be computed using constrained Lagrangian dynamics. With regards to biological polymers, there appears to be an intricate link between the entropic force and function. For example, disordered polypeptide segments –  in the context of the folded regions of the same polypeptide chain –  have been shown to generate an entropic force that has functional implications.<br>Hydrophobic force[edit]<br><br>See also: Hydrophobic effect § Cause<br>Water drops on the surface of grass<br>Another example of an entropic force is the hydrophobic force. At room temperature, it partly originates from the loss of entropy by the 3D network of water molecules when they interact with molecules of dissolved substance. Each water molecule is capable of<br>donating two hydrogen bonds through the two protons,<br>accepting two more hydrogen bonds through the two sp-hybridized lone pairs.<br>Therefore, water molecules can form an extended three-dimensional network.  Introduction of a non-hydrogen-bonding surface disrupts this network.  The water molecules rearrange themselves around the surface, so as to minimize the number of disrupted hydrogen bonds.  This is in contrast to hydrogen fluoride (which can accept 3 but donate only 1) or ammonia (which can donate 3 but accept only 1), which mainly form linear chains.<br>If the introduced surface had an ionic or polar nature, there would be water molecules standing upright on 1 (along the axis of an orbital for ionic bond) or 2 (along a resultant polarity axis) of the four sp orbitals. These orientations allow easy movement, i.e. degrees of freedom, and thus lowers entropy minimally. But a non-hydrogen-bonding surface with a moderate curvature forces the water molecule to sit tight on the surface, spreading 3 hydrogen bonds tangential to the surface, which then become locked in a clathrate-like basket shape. Water molecules involved in this clathrate-like basket around the non-hydrogen-bonding surface are constrained in their orientation. Thus, any event that would minimize such a surface is entropically favored. For example, when two such hydrophobic particles come very close, the clathrate-like baskets surrounding them merge.  This releases some of the water molecules into the bulk of the water, leading to an increase in entropy.<br>Another related and counter-intuitive example of entropic force is protein folding, which is a spontaneous process and where hydrophobic effect also plays a role. Structures of water-soluble proteins typically have a core in which hydrophobic side chains are buried from water, which stabilizes the folded state. Charged and polar side chains are situated on the solvent-exposed surface where they interact with surrounding water molecules. Minimizing the number of hydrophobic side chains exposed to water is the principal driving force behind the folding process, although formation of hydrogen bonds within the protein also stabilizes protein structure.<br>Colloids[edit]<br>Entropic forces are important and widespread in the physics of colloids, where they are responsible for the depletion force, and the ordering of hard particles, such as the crystallization of hard spheres, the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystal phases of hard rods, and the ordering of hard polyhedra. Because of this, entropic forces can be an important driver of self-assembly<br>Entropic forces arise in colloidal systems due to the osmotic pressure that comes from particle crowding. This was first discovered in, and is most intuitive for, colloid-polymer mixtures described by the Asakura–Oosawa model. In this model, polymers are approximated as finite-sized spheres that can penetrate one another, but cannot penetrate the colloidal particles. The inability of the polymers to penetrate the colloids leads to a region around the colloids in which the polymer density is reduced. If the regions of reduced polymer density around two colloids overlap with one another, by means of the colloids approaching one another, the polymers in the system gain an additional free volume that is equal to the volume of the intersection of the reduced density regions. The additional free volume causes an increase in the entropy of the polymers, and drives them to form locally dense-packed aggregates. A similar effect occurs in sufficiently dense colloidal systems without polymers, where osmotic pressure also drives the local dense packing of colloids into a diverse array of structures  that can be rationally designed by modifying the shape of the particles. These effects are for anisotropic particles referred to as directional entropic forces.<br>Cytoskeleton[edit]<br>Contractile forces in biological cells are typically driven by molecular motors associated with the cytoskeleton. However, a growing body of evidence shows that contractile forces may also be of entropic origin. The foundational example is the action of microtubule crosslinker Ase1, which localizes to microtubule overlaps in the mitotic spindle. Molecules of Ase1 are confined to the microtubule overlap, where they are free to diffuse one-dimensionally. Analogically to an ideal gas in a container, molecules of Ase1 generate pressure on the overlap ends. This pressure drives the overlap expansion, which results in the contractile sliding of the microtubules. An analogous example was found in the actin cytoskeleton. Here, the actin-bundling protein anillin drives actin contractility in cytokinetic rings.
