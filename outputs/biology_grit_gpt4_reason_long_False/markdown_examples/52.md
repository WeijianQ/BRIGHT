## Original Question

*Are two eyes necessary for 3D vision?
It has always been my understanding that humans have two eyes so that we can have 3D vision: the left eye sees more of the left side of an object than the right eye and vice versa. This helps us to estimate depth among other things.
Now when I close one eye, I still am able to perceive depth. I assume this is because my brain fills in the blanks For how long does this work? Do people eventually lose the depth perception (or at least it diminishes significantly) when they lose a single eye?
If so, how low does it take? If not, clearly we are capable of perceiving everything with one eye. Why do we then have two (besides redundancy and a larger field of view)? What is considering the evolution of man better in having two eyes as opposed to one or three, or four,..?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here revolves around understanding the role of binocular (two-eyed) vision in perceiving depth and 3D shapes, and whether a single eye can compensate for the loss of depth perception over time. You're also curious about the evolutionary advantage of having two eyes instead of one, three, or more. Let's address these questions step by step.

### Depth Perception with Two Eyes vs. One Eye

**Binocular Vision**: Humans and many other animals have two eyes positioned at the front of the head, allowing for binocular vision. This setup gives us a slightly different view from each eye, a phenomenon known as binocular disparity. Our brains merge these two slightly different images into one, allowing us to perceive depth and 3D shapes. This is crucial for tasks that require precise depth judgments, such as catching a ball or navigating complex terrains.

**Monocular Cues**: Even with one eye closed, or for people who are monocular (having vision in only one eye), depth perception is still possible through monocular cues. These include:
- **Size**: Larger objects are perceived as closer.
- **Overlap**: If one object overlaps another, it is perceived as closer.
- **Texture Gradient**: Textures appear denser the further away they are.
- **Linear Perspective**: Parallel lines appear to converge in the distance.
- **Motion Parallax**: Objects closer move faster across our field of vision than those further away.

### Adaptation Over Time

When someone loses the use of one eye, they don't lose depth perception entirely but do have to rely more on monocular cues. Initially, tasks requiring precise depth perception might be challenging, but over time, the brain adapts to interpreting these monocular cues more effectively. The timeline for this adaptation can vary widely among individuals, depending on factors like the age at which they lost the use of one eye, their overall neurological health, and how much they practice tasks that require depth perception.

### Why Two Eyes?

Having two eyes offers several advantages over having just one:
- **Wider Field of View**: Two eyes positioned side by side provide a broader visual field, which is crucial for detecting predators or prey.
- **Redundancy**: Losing an eye doesn't result in complete blindness, providing a survival advantage.
- **Depth Perception**: As discussed, binocular vision provides a more accurate depth perception, important for navigating environments and manipulating objects.

### Why Not More Than Two Eyes?

Evolution tends to favor what's efficient for survival and reproduction. More eyes could mean more visual information to process, requiring larger brains and more energy. Two eyes seem to be the optimal number for most vertebrates, balancing the benefits of depth perception and field of view with the metabolic costs of processing visual information.

In summary, while two eyes enhance depth perception and provide a wider field of view, humans and other animals can adapt to rely on monocular cues for depth perception if necessary. The evolutionary advantage of having two eyes likely revolves around the balance between the benefits they offer and the metabolic costs of maintaining and processing the information they provide.

> Binocular disparity refers to the difference in image location of an object seen by the left and right eyes, resulting from the eyes’ horizontal separation (parallax). The mind uses binocular disparity to extract depth information from the two-dimensional retinal images in stereopsis. In computer vision, binocular disparity refers to the difference in coordinates of similar features within two stereo images.<br>A similar disparity can be used in rangefinding by a coincidence rangefinder to determine distance and/or altitude to a target. In astronomy, the disparity between different locations on the Earth can be used to determine various celestial parallax, and Earth's orbit can be used for stellar parallax.

> Tricking neurons with 2D images[edit]<br>Figure 2. Simulation of disparity from depth in the plane. (relates to Figure 1)<br>Brain cells (neurons) in a part of the brain responsible for processing visual information coming from the retinae (primary visual cortex) can detect the existence of disparity in their input from the eyes. Specifically, these neurons will be active, if an object with "their" special disparity lies within the part of the visual field to which they have access (receptive field).<br>Researchers investigating precise properties of these neurons with respect to disparity present visual stimuli with different disparities to the cells and look whether they are active or not. One possibility to present stimuli with different disparities is to place objects in varying depth in front of the eyes. However, the drawback to this method may not be precise enough for objects placed further away as they possess smaller disparities while objects closer will have greater disparities. Instead, neuroscientists use an alternate method as schematised in Figure 2.<br>Figure 2: The disparity of an object with different depth than the fixation point can alternatively be produced by presenting an image of the object to one eye and a laterally shifted version of the same image to the other eye. The full black circle is the point of fixation. Objects in varying depths are placed along the line of fixation of the left eye. The same disparity produced from a shift in depth of an object (filled coloured circles) can also be produced by laterally shifting the object in constant depth in the picture one eye sees (black circles with coloured margin). Note that for near disparities the lateral shift has to be larger to correspond to the same depth compared with far disparities. This is what neuroscientists usually do with random dot stimuli to study disparity selectivity of neurons since the lateral distance required to test disparities is less than the distances required using depth tests. This principle has also been applied in autostereogram illusions.

> Definition[edit]<br>Figure 1. Definition of binocular disparity (far and near).<br>Human eyes are horizontally separated by about 50–75 mm (interpupillary distance) depending on each individual. Thus, each eye has a slightly different view of the world around. This can be easily seen when alternately closing one eye while looking at a vertical edge. The binocular disparity can be observed from apparent horizontal shift of the vertical edge between both views.<br>At any given moment, the line of sight of the two eyes meet at a point in space. This point in space projects to the same location (i.e. the center) on the retinae of the two eyes. Because of the different viewpoints observed by the  left and right eye however, many other points in space do not fall on corresponding retinal locations. Visual binocular disparity is defined as the difference between the point of projection in the two  eyes and is usually expressed in degrees as the visual angle.<br>The term "binocular disparity" refers to geometric measurements made external to the eye. The disparity of the images on the actual retina depends on factors internal to the eye, especially the location of the nodal points, even if the cross section of the retina is a perfect circle. Disparity on retina conforms to binocular disparity when measured as degrees, while much different if measured as distance due to the complicated structure inside eye.<br>Figure 1: The full black circle is the point of fixation. The blue object lies nearer to the observer. Therefore, it has a "near" disparity dn. Objects lying more far away (green) correspondingly have a "far" disparity df. Binocular disparity is the angle between two lines of projection . One of which is the real projection from the object to the actual point of projection. The other one is the imaginary projection running through the nodal point of the fixation point.<br>In computer vision, binocular disparity is calculated from stereo images taken from a set of stereo cameras. The variable distance between these cameras, called the baseline, can affect the disparity of a specific point on their respective image plane. As the baseline increases, the disparity increases due to the greater angle needed to align the sight on the point. However, in computer vision, binocular disparity is referenced as coordinate differences of the point between the right and left images instead of a visual angle. The units are usually measured in pixels.
