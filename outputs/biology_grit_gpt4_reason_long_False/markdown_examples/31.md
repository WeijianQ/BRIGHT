## Original Question

*Did neanderthals need vitamin C from the diet?
Modern humans need to get vitamin c from the diet, because we do not make it ourselves. Did neanderthals produce vitamin c? At what point of evolution exactly was this ability lost?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here is to determine whether Neanderthals, like modern humans, needed to obtain vitamin C from their diets due to an inability to synthesize it themselves, and at what point in evolution this ability was lost.

### Step 1: Understanding Vitamin C Synthesis in Animals

Most animals can synthesize their own vitamin C (ascorbic acid) through a series of enzymatic reactions. This process involves converting glucose to vitamin C. However, some animals, including humans, have lost this ability and must obtain vitamin C from their diet to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency.

### Step 2: Evolutionary Loss of Vitamin C Synthesis

The loss of vitamin C synthesis in humans is attributed to a mutation in the gene for L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), the enzyme responsible for the last step in vitamin C synthesis. This mutation is believed to have occurred in the ancestors of all haplorhine primates (which includes humans, apes, and monkeys) approximately 40 to 60 million years ago. Since this event predates the emergence of hominins (the group that includes modern humans and our direct ancestors), it is reasonable to infer that all hominins, including Neanderthals, lacked the ability to synthesize vitamin C and thus needed to obtain it from their diet.

### Step 3: Implications for Neanderthal Diet

Knowing that Neanderthals, like modern humans, could not synthesize vitamin C implies that their diet had to include sources of this vital nutrient. This would have significant implications for understanding Neanderthal dietary habits and their environment. For example, it suggests that Neanderthals consumed a varied diet that included vitamin C-rich foods such as fruits and vegetables or possibly even raw meat, which contains small amounts of vitamin C.

### Step 4: Archaeological and Genetic Evidence

While direct genetic evidence confirming the lack of vitamin C synthesis in Neanderthals specifically might be limited, comparative genomics can offer clues. By comparing the genomes of modern humans, Neanderthals, and other primates, scientists can identify shared genetic traits and mutations, such as the GULO gene mutation. Archaeological evidence, such as analysis of Neanderthal dental plaque and isotopic analysis of bone collagen, can also provide indirect evidence of their diet and nutritional intake.

### Conclusion

Based on the evolutionary timeline and the shared genetic heritage of all haplorhine primates, it is highly likely that Neanderthals, like modern humans, were unable to synthesize vitamin C and thus required dietary sources of this essential nutrient. This aspect of Neanderthal biology underscores the importance of a varied diet and provides insights into the evolutionary pressures that shaped the dietary habits of early human relatives. Further research into Neanderthal genetics and archaeology could provide more direct evidence and deepen our understanding of how these ancient humans managed their nutritional needs.

> Consequences of loss[edit]<br>It is likely that some level of adaptation occurred after the loss of the GULO gene by primates. Erythrocyte Glut1 and associated dehydroascorbic acid uptake modulated by stomatin switch are unique traits of humans and the few other mammals that have lost the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid from glucose. As GLUT transporters and stomatin are ubiquitously distributed in different human cell types and tissues, similar interactions may occur in human cells other than erythrocytes.<br>Linus Pauling observed that after the loss of endogenous ascorbate production, apo(a) and Lp(a)  were greatly favored by evolution, acting as ascorbate surrogate, since the frequency of occurrence of elevated Lp(a) plasma levels in species that had lost the ability to synthesize ascorbate is great. Also, only primates share regulation of CAMP gene expression by vitamin D, which occurred after the loss of GULO gene.<br>Johnson et al. have hypothesized that the mutation of the GULOP pseudogene so that it stopped producing GULO may have been of benefit to early primates by increasing uric acid levels and enhancing fructose effects on weight gain and fat accumulation.
