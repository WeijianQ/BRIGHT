## Original Question

*Why do cyanide and arsenic smell like almonds and garlic, respectively?
Why do humans smell arsenic as garlic or cyanide as almonds? Do both smells activate the same receptor? Is there any reason why our brain interprets these smells the same?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem here revolves around understanding why cyanide is often reported to smell like almonds and arsenic like garlic, focusing on the biological and chemical mechanisms behind these odor perceptions and whether these perceptions are mediated by the same olfactory receptors.

### Step 1: Understanding Odor Perception

The first step is to understand how humans perceive smells. Odor molecules bind to olfactory receptors in the nose, each of which is tuned to detect a few specific types of molecules. When an odor molecule binds to its corresponding receptor, it initiates a signal that is sent to the brain, where it is interpreted as a particular smell. Different molecules can activate the same or similar sets of receptors, leading to similar odor perceptions.

### Step 2: Cyanide and the Smell of Almonds

Cyanide can smell like bitter almonds to some people. This specific odor perception is not universal; the ability to detect it is genetically determined. The compound that specifically gives almonds their characteristic smell is benzaldehyde. Cyanide, particularly hydrogen cyanide (HCN), can produce a similar smell due to its chemical structure and the way it interacts with olfactory receptors. However, not everyone can detect this odor due to genetic variations in their olfactory receptors.

### Step 3: Arsenic and the Smell of Garlic

Arsenic itself is a metalloid and does not have a smell. However, arsine gas (AsH3), a compound of arsenic, has a garlic-like odor. This smell is due to the interaction of arsine gas molecules with olfactory receptors, which are sensitive to thiols and other sulfur-containing compounds. Garlic naturally contains sulfur compounds, which are responsible for its distinctive odor. Arsine, through its interaction with similar or the same olfactory receptors that detect these sulfur compounds, can produce a garlic-like smell.

### Step 4: Are the Same Receptors Involved?

Considering the chemical diversity between cyanide and arsenic compounds, it is unlikely that they activate the exact same olfactory receptor. The perception of almond and garlic odors is more likely due to the activation of different sets of receptors that are sensitive to the specific molecular structures and elements present in cyanide and arsenic compounds, respectively.

### Conclusion

The perception of cyanide as smelling like almonds and arsenic (or arsine gas) as smelling like garlic is due to the interaction of these compounds with specific olfactory receptors in the nose. The similarity in odor perception is not because they activate the same receptor but rather because the compounds contain or produce elements or structures that mimic the odor-active compounds in almonds and garlic. The genetic variation among individuals can influence the ability to detect these odors, leading to differences in perception. Thus, while the brain interprets these smells as similar to more familiar ones, the underlying chemical interactions and genetic factors are complex and distinct for each substance.

> Mechanism[edit]<br>See also: Docking theory of olfaction and Odotope theory<br>Rather than binding specific ligands, olfactory receptors display affinity for a range of odor molecules, and conversely a single odorant molecule may bind to a number of olfactory receptors with varying affinities, which depend on physio-chemical properties of molecules like their molecular volumes.  Once the odorant has bound to the odor receptor, the receptor undergoes structural changes and it binds and activates the olfactory-type G protein on the inside of the olfactory receptor neuron. The G protein (Golf and/or Gs) in turn activates the lyase - adenylate cyclase - which converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP).  The cAMP opens cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels which allow calcium and sodium ions to enter into the cell, depolarizing the olfactory receptor neuron and beginning an action potential which carries the information to the brain.<br>Metalloprotein–ligand interactions[edit]<br>The primary sequences of thousands of olfactory receptors are known from the genomes of more than a dozen organisms:  they are seven-helix transmembrane proteins, but there are very few solved structures. Their sequences exhibit typical class A GPCR motifs, useful for building their structures with molecular modeling. Golebiowski, Ma and Matsunami showed that the mechanism of ligand recognition, although similar to other non-olfactory class A GPCRs, involves residues specific to olfactory receptors, notably in the sixth helix. There is a highly conserved sequence in roughly three quarters of all ORs that is a tripodal metal ion binding site, and Suslick has proposed that the ORs are in fact metalloproteins (mostly likely with zinc, copper and possibly manganese ions) that serve as a Lewis acid site for binding of many odorant molecules. Crabtree, in 1978, had previously suggested that Cu(I) is "the most likely candidate for a metallo-receptor site in olfaction" for strong-smelling volatiles which are also good metal-coordinating ligands, such as thiols. Zhuang, Matsunami and Block, in 2012, confirmed the Crabtree/Suslick proposal for the specific case of a mouse OR, MOR244-3, showing that copper is essential for detection of certain thiols and other sulfur-containing compounds. Thus, by using a chemical that binds to copper in the mouse nose, so that copper wasn’t available to the receptors, the authors showed that the mice couldn't detect the thiols. However, these authors also found that MOR244-3 lacks the specific metal ion binding site suggested by Suslick, instead showing a different motif in the EC2 domain.<br>Malfunction of the metalloproteins in the olfactory system is hypothesized to have a connection with amyloidal based neurodegenerative diseases.<br>Vibrational theory of olfaction[edit]<br><br>Main article: Vibration theory of olfaction<br>In a recent but highly controversial interpretation, it has also been speculated that olfactory receptors might really sense various vibrational energy-levels of a molecule rather than structural motifs via quantum coherence mechanisms. As evidence it has been shown that flies can differentiate between two odor molecules which only differ in hydrogen isotope (which will drastically change vibrational energy levels of the molecule). Not only could the flies distinguish between the deuterated and non-deuterated forms of an odorant, they could generalise the property of "deuteratedness" to other novel molecules. In addition, they generalised the learned avoidance behaviour to molecules which were not deuterated but did share a significant vibration stretch with the deuterated molecules, a fact which the differential physics of deuteration (below) has difficulty in accounting for.<br>Deuteration changes the heats of adsorption and the boiling and freezing points of molecules (boiling points:  100.0 °C for H2O vs. 101.42 °C for D2O; melting points: 0.0 °C for H2O, 3.82 °C for D2O), pKa (i.e., dissociation constant: 9.71x10 for H2O vs. 1.95x10 for D2O, cf. heavy water) and the strength of hydrogen bonding.  Such isotope effects are exceedingly common, and so it is well known that deuterium substitution will indeed change the binding constants of molecules to protein receptors.<br>It has been claimed that  human olfactory receptors are capable of distinguishing between deuterated and undeuterated isotopomers of cyclopentadecanone by vibrational energy level sensing. However this claim has been challenged by another report that the human musk-recognizing receptor, OR5AN1 that robustly responds to cyclopentadecanone and muscone, fails to distinguish isotopomers of these compounds in vitro. Furthermore, the mouse (methylthio)methanethiol-recognizing receptor, MOR244-3, as well as other selected human and mouse olfactory receptors, responded similarly to normal, deuterated, and carbon-13 isotopomers of their respective ligands, paralleling results found with the musk receptor OR5AN1. Hence it was concluded that the proposed vibration theory does not apply to the human musk receptor OR5AN1, mouse thiol receptor MOR244-3, or other olfactory receptors examined.  In addition, the proposed electron transfer mechanism of the vibrational frequencies of odorants could be easily suppressed by quantum effects of nonodorant molecular vibrational modes. Hence multiple lines of evidence argue against the vibration theory of smell.  This later study was criticized since it used "cells in a dish rather than within whole organisms" and that "expressing an olfactory receptor in human embryonic kidney cells doesn't adequately reconstitute the complex nature of olfaction...". In response, the authors of the second study state "Embryonic kidney cells are not identical to the cells in the nose .. but if you are looking at receptors, it's the best system in the world."

> Diversity[edit]<br>There are a large number of different odor receptors, with as many as 1,000 in the mammalian genome which represents approximately 3% of the genes in the genome.  However, not all of these potential odor receptor genes are expressed and functional.  According to an analysis of data derived from the Human Genome Project, humans have approximately 400 functional genes coding for olfactory receptors, and the remaining 600 candidates are pseudogenes.<br>The reason for the large number of different odor receptors is to provide a system for discriminating between as many different odors as possible.  Even so, each odor receptor does not detect a single odor.  Rather each individual odor receptor is broadly tuned to be activated by a number of similar odorant structures.  Analogous to the immune system, the diversity that exists within the olfactory receptor family allows molecules that have never been encountered before to be characterized. However, unlike the immune system, which generates diversity through in-situ recombination, every single olfactory receptor is translated from a specific gene; hence the large portion of the genome devoted to encoding OR genes. Furthermore, most odors activate more than one type of odor receptor. Since the number of combinations and permutations of olfactory receptors is very large, the olfactory receptor system is capable of detecting and distinguishing between a very large number of odorant molecules.<br>Deorphanization of odor receptors can be completed using electrophysiological and imaging techniques to analyze the response profiles of single sensory neurons to odor repertoires. Such data open the way to the deciphering of the combinatorial code of the perception of smells.<br>Such diversity of OR expression maximizes the capacity of olfaction. Both monoallelic OR expression in a single neuron and maximal diversity of OR expression in the neuron population are essential for specificity and sensitivity of olfactory sensing. Thus, olfactory receptor activation is a dual-objective design problem. Using mathematical modeling and computer simulations, Tian et al proposed an evolutionarily optimized three-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic barrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop and an enhancer competition step<br><br>. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR expression but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and maintains the diversity of OR expression.
