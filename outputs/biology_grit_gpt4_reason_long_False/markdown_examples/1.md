## Original Question

*Why do I only breathe out of one nostril?
I was just sitting with my hand next to my nose and I realized that air was only coming out of the right nostril. Why is that? I would think I would use both, it seems much more efficient. Have I always only been breathing out of my right nostril?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're experiencing is that you've noticed air is only coming out of one nostril, specifically your right nostril, and you're wondering why this is happening and whether it's normal or indicative of a broader issue.

1. **Understanding Nasal Cycle**: The first step to addressing your concern is to understand that what you're experiencing is likely a part of the normal nasal cycle. The human body is designed to primarily use one nostril at a time to breathe, with the dominant nostril switching every few hours. This process is controlled by the autonomic nervous system and is something most people are not consciously aware of.

2. **Reasons for the Nasal Cycle**: The nasal cycle serves several purposes. It helps regulate airflow, ensuring that one nostril is always moistening, warming, or filtering the air more efficiently than the other. This can also help with detecting a wider range of smells, as different nostrils can pick up different scents better. Additionally, the cycle allows each nostril to rest and recover from constant airflow, reducing the risk of drying out or becoming irritated.

3. **Factors Influencing Nasal Breathing**: Various factors can influence which nostril is more dominant at any given time or make it more noticeable. These include your body's position (lying on one side can affect airflow), the current state of your health (congestion due to a cold or allergies can block one nostril more than the other), and even the time of day.

4. **When to Be Concerned**: Generally, only breathing out of one nostril at a time is not a cause for concern. However, if you find that the airflow is significantly restricted for an extended period, or if you experience discomfort, it could be indicative of a blockage or other issues such as a deviated septum, nasal polyps, or chronic sinusitis. In such cases, consulting with a healthcare professional is advisable.

5. **Observation and Consultation**: If this phenomenon is new to you, it might be beneficial to pay attention to whether the dominant nostril switches after a few hours. If you notice any patterns of discomfort, persistent blockage, or if you're simply curious about your nasal health, a visit to an ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat) specialist could provide you with more personalized information and peace of mind.

In conclusion, only breathing out of one nostril at a time is part of a natural and beneficial process for your body. Unless it's accompanied by discomfort or other symptoms, it's generally not something to worry about. However, being aware of your body and seeking professional advice when something feels off is always a good practice.

> Description[edit]<br>The nasal cycle was studied and discussed in the ancient Indian yoga of literature of pranayama. In the modern western literature, it was first described by the German physician Richard Kayser  in 1895.<br>In 1927, Heetderks described the alternating turgescence of the inferior turbinates in 80% of a normal population. According to Heetderks, the cycle is the result of alternating congestion and decongestion of the nasal conchae or turbinates, predominantly the inferior turbinates, which are by far the largest of the turbinates in each nasal fossa.  Turbinates consist of bony projections covered by erectile tissue, much like the tissues of the penis and clitoris.  The turbinates in one fossa fill up with blood while the opposite turbinates decongest by shunting blood away. This cycle, which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, has a mean duration of two and a half hours but varies widely with age, body-posture, and other conditions. He further observed and documented that the turbinates in the dependent nasal fossa fill when the patient is lying down. The nasal cycle is an alternation in both time and between left and right sides, with the total resistance in the nose remaining constant. The asymmetric airflow may have some benefit to overall olfactory sensitivity. In patients with a fixed septal deviation and intermittent nasal obstruction, the interplay of the nasal cycle becomes evident; the sensation of obstruction frequently mirrors the congestion phase.<br>It is possible that the nasal cycle may exacerbate the nasal congestion caused by the common cold, as the lack of motility of the cilia in one half of the nose may lead to an uncomfortable sensation of not being able to shift mucus by blowing the nose.

> The nasal cycle is the unconscious alternating partial congestion and decongestion of the nasal cavities in humans and other animals. This results in greater airflow through one nostril with periodic alternation between the nostrils. It is a physiological congestion of the nasal conchae, also called the nasal turbinates (curled bony projections within the nasal cavities), due to selective activation of one half of the autonomic nervous system by the hypothalamus. It should not be confused with pathological nasal congestion.

> Research on the effects[edit]<br>A 1994 study suggested that breathing through alternate nostrils can affect brain hemisphere symmetry on EEG topography. A later study in 2007 showed that this cycle (as well as manipulation through forced nostril breathing on one side) has an effect on endogenous ultradian rhythms of the autonomic and central nervous system.<br>However, more recent research has shown no statistically significant association between spontaneously (i.e., not forced) dominant nostril and active brain hemisphere.
