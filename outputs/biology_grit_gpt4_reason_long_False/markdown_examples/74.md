# Query `74`

## Original Question

*Why do birches have a white bark?
Several species of the tree genres Betula have a white bark,especially when they are young. This is quite peculiar to trees - at least in central Europe; so I'm wondering if there is a ecological reason behind it.
The first idea I have is that they protection against the sun. But normally protection of nature against the sun is to make the opposite: put more pigments in the skin, so that the sun does not damage the underlying DNA. If this is the explanation, how do other tree species protect against this?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're inquiring about is understanding why several species of birches (genus Betula) have white bark, especially when they are young, and whether there is an ecological reason behind this characteristic that is somewhat peculiar, particularly in central Europe. Your hypothesis suggests a connection between bark color and protection against the sun, questioning how this aligns with the common strategy in nature of using pigments to protect against sun damage.

### Step 1: Understanding the Function of White Bark

**Reflectance and Cooling:** Unlike the common strategy of using dark pigments to absorb UV radiation and protect underlying cells, the white bark of birch trees reflects sunlight. This reflectance can reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the tree, keeping the bark cooler. In cold climates or during winter when trees are dormant, and the sun is low, this reflection can prevent the bark from warming up too quickly, which can lead to cellular damage or premature breaking of dormancy.

**Protection Against Sunscald:** In winter, the sun can warm the bark, causing cells to come out of dormancy. When the temperature drops again, these active cells can be damaged. The white bark minimizes this risk by reflecting sunlight, keeping the bark temperature more consistent.

### Step 2: Ecological Reasons and Adaptations

**Habitat and Evolution:** Birch trees are commonly found in northern climates and high altitudes where the reflective property of their bark can be particularly advantageous. The white bark could be an evolutionary adaptation to these environments, offering a unique solution to challenges faced by trees in these regions.

**Pest and Disease Resistance:** The white bark may also play a role in pest and disease resistance. Some theories suggest that the smooth and reflective surface of the bark makes it difficult for certain pests to anchor and climb, reducing infestation rates.

### Step 3: Comparison with Other Tree Species

**Different Strategies for Different Environments:** Other tree species have evolved different strategies to protect against sun damage. For example, some trees produce thicker bark or more pigments (such as tannins) that can absorb UV light and protect the tree's inner layers. These adaptations vary based on the tree's environment, evolutionary history, and specific challenges it faces.

**Chemical Sunscreens:** Additionally, some trees may produce chemicals within their bark that function similarly to sunscreens, absorbing harmful radiation before it can damage the tree's DNA.

### Conclusion

The white bark of birch trees is an interesting adaptation that serves multiple purposes, including protection against sunscald and potentially aiding in pest and disease resistance. This characteristic is particularly beneficial in the environments where birches commonly grow, reflecting an evolutionary response to their specific ecological niches. Other tree species, facing different environmental challenges, have developed alternative strategies to protect against sun damage, showcasing the diversity of adaptations in the plant kingdom.

The damage in this case will appear as sunken or dead bark on the trunk of the tree, then later in the tree's life the bark might fall away revealing dead tissue in the tree's cambium layer. This damage will typically be found on the south west facing side of the tree's trunk. It can be found on other sides of the tree if there is light reflection from other sources, like man made structures or reflective rock faces. After a tree is afflicted by sun scald it becomes much more vulnerable to decay organisms. The plant will create walls around the affected area, but sometimes it is not enough to block the infections. The leaves of the tree are also affected by sun scald, particularly on a bright sunny day following a period of warm cloudy humidity. The damage to the leaves will start as bronzing of the epidermis between the veins of the leaf, and if the sunny conditions persist the tissue of the leaf will die.

> Causes[edit]<br>The reason the sun can cause so much damage to trees is because of dormancy. When a tree is dormant in the winter it can be reactivated by warm weather. In the northern woods trees are exposed to the most sunlight and heat on the southwest facing side, so this side is heated during warm sunny winter days (in the afternoon, that's why westwards) to the point that it can be awoken from dormancy. The temperature required to wake up a tree depends on plant species and length of day, but it is typically just above freezing. Once active, the cells on the southwest side of the plant are unable to return to dormancy by nightfall, at which time the temperature returns to levels capable of killing active cells. Fluctuating winter temperatures can also cause frost cracks, which result from the expanding and contracting of the tree trunk.

Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation. Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make.
