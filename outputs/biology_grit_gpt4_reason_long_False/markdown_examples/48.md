## Original Question

*Why does strenous exercise cause vision of "lights"?
I had a hard climb a week ago. I got so tired then any time I closed my eyes I saw these lights inside my head. I see these lights almost every time that I run fast or some thing like that. What are they and where do they come from?*

## GPT-4 Reasoning

The essential problem you're experiencing is the vision of "lights" or visual phenomena during or after strenuous exercise, such as running or climbing. This is a curious and not uncommon phenomenon that can be unsettling if you're not sure why it's happening. Let's break down the possible reasons and mechanisms behind this experience.

1. **Increased Blood Pressure and Blood Flow**: Strenuous exercise causes an increase in blood pressure and blood flow, including to the eyes and brain. This heightened pressure can stimulate the retinal and visual cortex cells, potentially leading to the perception of lights or flashes. These are often referred to as "phosphenes," which are the perception of light without light actually entering the eye. Phosphenes can be caused by mechanical stimulation of the retina or electrical stimulation of the brain.

2. **Hyperventilation**: During intense physical activity, you may breathe more rapidly and deeply (hyperventilate), leading to changes in carbon dioxide levels in your blood. Hyperventilation can cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) in the brain, which might alter visual perception and contribute to seeing lights or flashes.

3. **Oxygen and Nutrient Demand**: High-intensity exercise significantly increases the demand for oxygen and nutrients in your muscles and brain. If, during peak physical exertion, the supply doesn't meet the demand, especially in the visual pathways or the brain, it might temporarily affect your vision, including the perception of lights.

4. **Endorphin Release**: Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers, which can create a feeling of euphoria often referred to as the "runner's high." While primarily a positive effect, this biochemical change can also affect your sensory perception, potentially contributing to visual phenomena.

5. **Migraine Aura**: Some individuals experience a migraine aura without the subsequent headache. Strenuous exercise can be a trigger for migraines or migraine aura in susceptible individuals. Auras often include visual disturbances such as flashing lights, zigzag patterns, or temporary vision loss.

**Addressing the Phenomenon**:

- **Hydration and Nutrition**: Ensure you are well-hydrated and have consumed adequate electrolytes and nutrients before engaging in strenuous activities. Imbalances can contribute to the issues described.

- **Breathing Techniques**: Practicing controlled breathing can help prevent hyperventilation and maintain a balanced carbon dioxide level in your blood.

- **Gradual Conditioning**: Gradually increasing the intensity of your workouts can help your body adapt better to the stresses of exercise, potentially reducing the occurrence of these visual phenomena.

- **Consult a Professional**: If the visual disturbances are frequent, severe, or accompanied by other symptoms (like a headache, dizziness, or loss of consciousness), it's important to consult with a healthcare professional or an eye specialist. They can rule out any underlying conditions and provide personalized advice.

In summary, seeing "lights" during or after strenuous exercise can result from several physiological responses to increased physical demand, including changes in blood flow, oxygen and nutrient delivery, and the body's biochemical state. For most people, these phenomena are harmless and temporary. However, if they become a concern, seeking professional advice is the best course of action.

An ancient, discredited theory is that light is generated in the eye.

> A phosphene is the phenomenon of seeing light without light entering the eye. The word phosphene comes from the Greek words phos (light) and phainein (to show).  Phosphenes that are induced by movement or sound may be associated with optic neuritis.<br>Phosphenes can be induced by mechanical, electrical, or magnetic stimulation of the retina or visual cortex, or by random firing of cells in the visual system. Phosphenes have also been reported by meditators (called nimitta), people who endure long periods without visual stimulation (the prisoner's cinema), or those who ingest psychedelic drugs.
