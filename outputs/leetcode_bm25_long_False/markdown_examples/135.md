# Query `135`

## Original Question

*You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return _the minimum possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.

Note:

   A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
   It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
   The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between `1` and `n`.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, roads = \[\[1,2,9\],\[2,3,6\],\[2,4,5\],\[1,4,7\]\]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, roads = \[\[1,2,2\],\[1,3,4\],\[3,4,7\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `1 <= roads.length <= 105`
   `roads[i].length == 3`
   `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
   `ai != bi`
   `1 <= distancei <= 104`
   There are no repeated edges.
   There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.*
