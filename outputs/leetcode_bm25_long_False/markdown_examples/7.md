# Query `7`

## Original Question

*A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return _the skyline formed by these buildings collectively_.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

   `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
   `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
   `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points " sorted by their x-coordinate in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

Example 1:

Input: buildings = \[\[2,9,10\],\[3,7,15\],\[5,12,12\],\[15,20,10\],\[19,24,8\]\]
Output: \[\[2,10\],\[3,15\],\[7,12\],\[12,0\],\[15,10\],\[20,8\],\[24,0\]\]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.

Example 2:

Input: buildings = \[\[0,2,3\],\[2,5,3\]\]
Output: \[\[0,3\],\[5,0\]\]

Constraints:

   `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
   `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
   `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
   `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.*
