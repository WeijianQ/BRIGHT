# Query `38`

## Original Question

*There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `ith` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return _the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side_. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

Example 1:

Input: row = \[0,2,1,3\]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row\[1\]) and third (row\[2\]) person.

Example 2:

Input: row = \[3,2,0,1\]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.

Constraints:

   `2n == row.length`
   `2 <= n <= 30`
   `n` is even.
   `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
   All the elements of `row` are unique.*
