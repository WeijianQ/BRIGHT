# Query `84`

## Original Question

*You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The population of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the inclusive range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is not counted in the year that they die.

Return _the earliest year with the maximum population_.

Example 1:

Input: logs = \[\[1993,1999\],\[2000,2010\]\]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

Example 2:

Input: logs = \[\[1950,1961\],\[1960,1971\],\[1970,1981\]\]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.

Constraints:

   `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
   `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`*
