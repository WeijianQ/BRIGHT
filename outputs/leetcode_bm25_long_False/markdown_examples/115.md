# Query `115`

## Original Question

*You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node `0` is the root, `parent[0] == -1`.

You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`.

Return _the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character assigned to them._

Example 1:

Input: parent = \[-1,0,0,1,1,2\], s =  "abacbe "
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters in the tree is the path: 0 -> 1 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.
It can be proven that there is no longer path that satisfies the conditions. 

Example 2:

Input: parent = \[-1,0,0,0\], s =  "aabc "
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path where each two adjacent nodes have different characters is the path: 2 -> 0 -> 3. The length of this path is 3, so 3 is returned.

Constraints:

   `n == parent.length == s.length`
   `1 <= n <= 105`
   `0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1` for all `i >= 1`
   `parent[0] == -1`
   `parent` represents a valid tree.
   `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.*
