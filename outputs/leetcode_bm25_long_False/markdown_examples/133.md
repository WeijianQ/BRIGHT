# Query `133`

## Original Question

*There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

At every node `i`, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers `amount`, where `amount[i]` represents:

   the price needed to open the gate at node `i`, if `amount[i]` is negative, or,
   the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node `i`, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

   Initially, Alice is at node `0` and Bob is at node `bob`.
   At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node `0`.
   For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
       If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
       If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is `c`, then both Alice and Bob pay `c / 2` each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is `c`, both of them receive `c / 2` each.
   If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node `0`, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

Return _the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node._

Example 1:

Input: edges = \[\[0,1\],\[1,2\],\[1,3\],\[3,4\]\], bob = 3, amount = \[-2,4,2,-4,6\]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Example 2:

Input: edges = \[\[0,1\]\], bob = 1, amount = \[-7280,2350\]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. 

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 105`
   `edges.length == n - 1`
   `edges[i].length == 2`
   `0 <= ai, bi < n`
   `ai != bi`
   `edges` represents a valid tree.
   `1 <= bob < n`
   `amount.length == n`
   `amount[i]` is an even integer in the range `[-104, 104]`.*

If the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not follow the subsequent snake or ladder.<br><br>   For example, suppose the board is `[[-1,4],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move, your destination square is `2`. You follow the ladder to square `3`, but do not follow the subsequent ladder to `4`.<br><br>Return _the least number of moves required to reach the square_ `n2`_. If it is not possible to reach the square, return_ `-1`.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: board = \[\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1\],\[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1\],\[-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1\]\]<br>Output: 4<br>Explanation: <br>In the beginning, you start at square 1 (at row 5, column 0).<br>You decide to move to square 2 and must take the ladder to square 15.<br>You then decide to move to square 17 and must take the snake to square 13.<br>You then decide to move to square 14 and must take the ladder to square 35.<br>You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.<br>This is the lowest possible number of moves to reach the last square, so return 4.<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: board = \[\[-1,-1\],\[-1,3\]\]<br>Output: 1<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `n == board.length == board[i].length`<br>   `2 <= n <= 20`<br>   `board[i][j]` is either `-1` or in the range `[1, n2]`.<br>   The squares labeled `1` and `n2` do not have any ladders or snakes."""<br><br>    n = len(piles)<br>    dp = [[0]  n for _ in range(n)]<br>    for gap in range(n):<br>        for i in range(n - gap):<br>            j = i + gap<br>            x = dp[i + 2][j] if i + 2 <= j else 0<br>            y = dp[i + 1][j - 1] if i + 1 <= j - 1 else 0<br>            z = dp[i][j - 2] if i <= j - 2 else 0<br>            dp[i][j] = max(piles[i] + min(x, y), piles[j] + min(y, z))<br>    sum_of_piles = sum(piles)<br>    return dp[0][n - 1]  (sum_of_piles - dp[0][n - 1])
