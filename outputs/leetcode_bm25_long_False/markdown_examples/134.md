# Query `134`

## Original Question

*A valid cut in a circle can be:

   A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
   A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.

Some valid and invalid cuts are shown in the figures below.

Given the integer `n`, return _the minimum number of cuts needed to divide a circle into_ `n` _equal slices_.

Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation:
At least 3 cuts are needed to divide the circle into 3 equal slices. 
It can be shown that less than 3 cuts cannot result in 3 slices of equal size and shape.
Also note that the first cut will not divide the circle into distinct parts.

Constraints:

   `1 <= n <= 100`*
