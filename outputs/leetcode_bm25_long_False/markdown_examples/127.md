# Query `127`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer array `ranks` and a character array `suits`. You have `5` cards where the `ith` card has a rank of `ranks[i]` and a suit of `suits[i]`.

The following are the types of poker hands you can make from best to worst:

1.  `"Flush "`: Five cards of the same suit.
2.  `"Three of a Kind "`: Three cards of the same rank.
3.  `"Pair "`: Two cards of the same rank.
4.  `"High Card "`: Any single card.

Return _a string representing the best type of poker hand you can make with the given cards._

Note that the return values are case-sensitive.

Example 1:

Input: ranks = \[13,2,3,1,9\], suits = \[ "a ", "a ", "a ", "a ", "a "\]
Output:  "Flush "
Explanation: The hand with all the cards consists of 5 cards with the same suit, so we have a  "Flush ".

Example 2:

Input: ranks = \[4,4,2,4,4\], suits = \[ "d ", "a ", "a ", "b ", "c "\]
Output:  "Three of a Kind "
Explanation: The hand with the first, second, and fourth card consists of 3 cards with the same rank, so we have a  "Three of a Kind ".
Note that we could also make a  "Pair " hand but  "Three of a Kind " is a better hand.
Also note that other cards could be used to make the  "Three of a Kind " hand.

Example 3:

Input: ranks = \[10,10,2,12,9\], suits = \[ "a ", "b ", "c ", "a ", "d "\]
Output:  "Pair "
Explanation: The hand with the first and second card consists of 2 cards with the same rank, so we have a  "Pair ".
Note that we cannot make a  "Flush " or a  "Three of a Kind ".

Constraints:

   `ranks.length == suits.length == 5`
   `1 <= ranks[i] <= 13`
   `'a' <= suits[i] <= 'd'`
   No two cards have the same rank and suit.*
