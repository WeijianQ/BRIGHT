# Query `96`

## Original Question

*A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with `n` vertices where each vertex is labeled from `1` to `n` (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is `time` minutes.

Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every `change` minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.

The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.

   For example the second minimum value of `[2, 3, 4]` is `3`, and the second minimum value of `[2, 2, 4]` is `4`.

Given `n`, `edges`, `time`, and `change`, return _the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex_ `1` _to vertex_ `n`.

Notes:

   You can go through any vertex any number of times, including `1` and `n`.
   You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.

Example 1:

       

Input: n = 5, edges = \[\[1,2\],\[1,3\],\[1,4\],\[3,4\],\[4,5\]\], time = 3, change = 5
Output: 13
Explanation:
The figure on the left shows the given graph.
The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
The time taken is:
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.

The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
- Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, edges = \[\[1,2\]\], time = 3, change = 2
Output: 11
Explanation:
The minimum time path is 1 -> 2 with time = 3 minutes.
The second minimum time path is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 with time = 11 minutes.

Constraints:

   `2 <= n <= 104`
   `n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2  104, n  (n - 1) / 2)`
   `edges[i].length == 2`
   `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
   `ui != vi`
   There are no duplicate edges.
   Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
   `1 <= time, change <= 103`*

> def can_split_string(s: str) - bool:<br>    """You are in a city that consists of `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with bi-directional roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.<br><br>You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei]` means that there is a road between intersections `ui` and `vi` that takes `timei` minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection `0` to intersection `n - 1` in the shortest amount of time.<br><br>Return _the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time_. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.<br><br>Example 1:<br><br>Input: n = 7, roads = \[\[0,6,7\],\[0,1,2\],\[1,2,3\],\[1,3,3\],\[6,3,3\],\[3,5,1\],\[6,5,1\],\[2,5,1\],\[0,4,5\],\[4,6,2\]\]<br>Output: 4<br>Explanation: The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.<br>The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:<br>- 0 ➝ 6<br>- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6<br>- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6<br>- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6<br><br>Example 2:<br><br>Input: n = 2, roads = \[\[1,0,10\]\]<br>Output: 1<br>Explanation: There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.<br><br>Constraints:<br><br>   `1 <= n <= 200`<br>   `n - 1 <= roads.length <= n  (n - 1) / 2`<br>   `roads[i].length == 3`<br>   `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`<br>   `1 <= timei <= 109`<br>   `ui != vi`<br>   There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.<br>   You can reach any intersection from any other intersection."""<br><br>    count = [0]  10<br><br>    for c in s:<br>        count[int(c)] += 1<br><br>    for i in range(1, 10):<br>        if count[i]  0 and count[i] == count[i - 1]:<br>            return True<br><br>    return False
