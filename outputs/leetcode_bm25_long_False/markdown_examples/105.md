# Query `105`

## Original Question

*You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the `ith` day.

A smooth descent period of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day by exactly `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return _the number of smooth descent periods_.

Example 1:

Input: prices = \[3,2,1,4\]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
\[3\], \[2\], \[1\], \[4\], \[3,2\], \[2,1\], and \[3,2,1\]
Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.

Example 2:

Input: prices = \[8,6,7,7\]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: \[8\], \[6\], \[7\], and \[7\]
Note that \[8,6\] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.

Example 3:

Input: prices = \[1\]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: \[1\]

Constraints:

   `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
   `1 <= prices[i] <= 105`*
