# Query `39`

## Original Question

*You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square_ `(n - 1, n - 1)` _if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,2\],\[1,3\]\]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,2,3,4\],\[24,23,22,21,5\],\[12,13,14,15,16\],\[11,17,18,19,20\],\[10,9,8,7,6\]\]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

Constraints:

   `n == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= n <= 50`
   `0 <= grid[i][j] < n2`
   Each value `grid[i][j]` is unique.*
