# Query `123`

## Original Question

*You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `grid` of size `m x n`. Each cell has one of two values:

   `0` represents an empty cell,
   `1` represents an obstacle that may be removed.

You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell.

Return _the minimum number of obstacles to remove so you can move from the upper left corner_ `(0, 0)` _to the lower right corner_ `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

Example 1:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,1\],\[1,1,0\],\[1,1,0\]\]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can remove the obstacles at (0, 1) and (0, 2) to create a path from (0, 0) to (2, 2).
It can be shown that we need to remove at least 2 obstacles, so we return 2.
Note that there may be other ways to remove 2 obstacles to create a path.

Example 2:

Input: grid = \[\[0,1,0,0,0\],\[0,1,0,1,0\],\[0,0,0,1,0\]\]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can move from (0, 0) to (2, 4) without removing any obstacles, so we return 0.

Constraints:

   `m == grid.length`
   `n == grid[i].length`
   `1 <= m, n <= 105`
   `2 <= m  n <= 105`
   `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
   `grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0`*
