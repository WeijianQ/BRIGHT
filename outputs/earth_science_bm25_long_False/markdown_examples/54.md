# Query `54`

## Original Question

*Bohrmann et al. 1989 advanced the idea that the silicate phase from some clinoptilolites come from the diagenetic degradation of biogenic opal (from radiolarians in that case but presumably also other siliceous microfossils).

If this hypothesis is still regarded as valid, is clinoptilolite the only kind of authigenic zeolite that can be traced to biogenic opal?

Has any work been done in that domain since this paper?

Despite the absence of celestite<br>from the geologic record, its importance lies in the influence on<br>recycling of Sr and Ba in the uppermost km of the ocean, with<br>important implications for chemical paleoceanographic interpretations of SryCa and BayCa ratios in corals and planktonic<br>foraminifera.<br>Fish-teeth apatite is highly useful for both stratigraphy and<br>chemical paleoceanography, especially in red clay deep-sea sediments where biogenic calcite and opal-A are absent because of<br>dissolution (37, 38).<br>Magnetite biomineralization first was identified in chiton teeth<br>(39), as it hardens their surface. The geologically important<br>magnetite consists of the morphologically distinct single domain<br>crystals formed by magnetotactic bacteria (39, 40).

This information is essential<br>for modeling the oceanic C cycle and atmospheric CO2 and O2<br>fluctuations (i.e., refs. 22, 43, and 44 and references therein).<br>Prime examples of periods with widely distributed organic C-rich<br>sediments are (a) the mid-Cretaceous abnormally organic C-rich<br>‘‘black’’ sediments in all major ocean basins, concentrated primarily in Aptian (115–110 Ma) and CenomanianyTuronian ('90<br>Ma) (i.e., refs. 45 and 46 and references therein), known as the<br>Crateceous Anoxic Events (CAE), and (b) the late Neogene<br>Mediterranean sapropels (i.e., ref. 47 and references therein).<br>The mid-Cretaceous organic C burial during the CAE has<br>significant implications for the ocean-atmosphere system C imbalance, as seen in the C isotopic composition of marine carbonates (48), hence on atmospheric O2 content. Such ‘‘black’’ shales<br>are potential reservoir rocks. Worldwide, Cretaceous strata are<br>known for being prolific hydrocarbon producers (i.e., refs. 49–51).<br>Authigenic Minerals. Authigenic minerals form by in situ<br>inorganic precipitation on the seafloor and within the sediment<br>column. Barite is the only mineral so far reported to also form in<br>the water column (52, 53). Some authigenic mineral reactions are<br>bacterially mediated; the bacteria modify the immediate geochemical environment, inducing mineral formation. For Paleoenvironmental studies, the most important marine authigenic<br>minerals are barite, francolite (a carbonate fluor apatite), evaporites, especially anhydriteygypsum and halite, and Mn-Feoxyhydroxide that occur as nodules or crusts. The concentrations<br>and isotopic compositions of oceanic conservative components in<br>these authigenic minerals that form at the seafloor are extremely<br>informative for studies of the history of seawater chemistry.<br>Nonconservative chemical components also reveal information<br>about distinct water masses, thus about ocean circulation in the<br>geologic past. In addition to diagenetic opal-CT and quartz that<br>form from the dissolution of biogenic opal-A, other common<br>authigenic alumino-silicate minerals are smectites and zeolites.<br>Dolomite and pyrite are also widespread authigenic minerals.<br>Authigenic alumino-silicates from both close to the sedimentseawater interface and the sediment column mainly form by<br>replacement of precursor minerals or mineraloids, but also can<br>form by direct precipitation from pore fluids. On short time scales<br>(decadal to millenial) the total amount of oceanic authigenic<br>silicate remineralization seems to exert an extremely small impact<br>on the global balance between CO2 degassing rate and atmospheric CO2 removal rate by continental weathering of silicates<br>(43, 54, 55). Research on the contribution of silicate remineralization to the global CO2 budget in the modern ocean presently<br>is being actively pursued (56).<br>The important marine clay minerals are smectites. The iron<br>smectite, nontronite, is widespread in the Pacific ocean floor<br>where hydrothermal activity is prevalent and sedimentation rates<br>are slow ,1 cmykyr. It forms at the seafloor from hydrothermal<br>Fe oxyhydroxides and opal-A (57). In addition, nontronite and<br>saponite replace precursor volcanic components, especially volcanic glass. Diagenetic illitic clays are celadonite and glauconite.<br>Celadonite is associated primarily with volcanic matter alteration.<br>Glauconite forms in subtropical and tropical margins in shallow<br>to intermediate water depths, near the sediment-water interface<br>beneath high productivity upwelling regions. These areas have<br>intermediate to slow sedimentation rates, and both ferric and<br>ferrous Fe are simultaneously available in pore waters. The<br>zeolite Phillipsite is common at the seafloor or at shallow burial<br>(58, 59). It replaces volcanic material in slow sedimentation<br>environments such as the South Pacific deep sea. Clinoptilolite is<br>also common and forms within the sediment column where silica<br>concentrations are elevated to stabilize it, mostly from opal-A<br>dissolution (59, 60). Occasionally clinoptilolite forms pseudomorphs after radiolaria tests (60). Analcime is significantly less<br>abundant and typically forms in volcanic ash-rich sediments (59).<br>Authigenic calcite is widespread in the ocean. It forms mostly<br>from biogenic calcite recyrstalization and is geochemically distinct in its minor and trace element concentrations from its<br>precursor. This recrystallization process ultimately transforms<br>calcareous ooze into chalk and limestone. Dolomite forms where<br>pore-fluid seawater is modified bacterially or by physicalchemical processes. In continental margins where pore fluids<br>become suboxic to anoxic, dolomite forms both as a primary<br>precipitate and by replacing precursor Ca and Ca-Mg carbonates<br>(61, 62). It also occurs in carbonate platforms where dolomite<br>replaces CaCO3 by the thermally driven convective flow of<br>seawater that is being inorganically and bacterially modified along<br>the flow path. The chemical and isotopic compositions, primarily<br>of carbon and oxygen, reveal the origins of the various dolomites.<br>Rhodochrosite and siderite are uncommon marine minerals.<br>Manganese and Fe mostly substitute for Mg in the dolomite<br>structure in suboxic to anoxic pore fluid environments where they<br>are mobilized. In these environments, only in the presence of<br>much detrital Mn and Fe, rhodochrosite andyor siderite may<br>form during late diagenesis where the reactions have driven<br>MgyCa ratios in the pore fluids to levels below dolomite stability.<br>Pyrite forms where sulfate is bacterially reduced. In these<br>environments Fe13 is reduced and mobilized, reacting with the<br>sulfide to form pyrite. Because of the large isotopic fractionation<br>by the bacterial reduction of sulfate to sulfide ('40%) the amount<br>of pyrite formation modulates the seawater-sulfate sulfur isotopic<br>composition and the atmospheric oxygen content, as discussed<br>below. Greigite, another Fe sulfide, may form kinetically instead<br>of pyrite, especially in the presence of Fe excess or in S-deficient<br>anoxic pore waters.

The discovery of massive sulfide deposits has had a profound impact on our<br>understanding of ore-forming processes, but their economic<br>significance is still uncertain.<br>At fast- and slow-spreading centers, seawater penetrates several km into oceanic basement (maximum depth is above the top<br>of the magma chamber), where it is heated to 350–400°C and<br>interacts with oceanic basement and sediments. This fluid ascends by buoyancy to form hydrothermal vents and sulfide
