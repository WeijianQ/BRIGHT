## Original Question

*I am following the paper to calculate UTCI using ERA5 meteorological variables.

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-020-01900-5?shared-article-renderer

In the paper, the authors have mentioned that they are using ERA5 product. And specifically mentioned to use the direct and diffuse component of shortwave (SW) radiation.

The problem is, ERA5 data does not provide the direct and diffuse SW separately. Rather it only provides Surface solar radiation downwards which includes both the direct and diffuse component.

My question would be, is there a way to calculate the direct and diffuse component of SW from ERA5. The dataset I have is similar to ERA5 and has the Downward SW and Net SW. I have no problem in obtaining the Long waves BTW.

Any help would be much appreciated. TIA*

The wind sub-model is<br>difficult to test widely (all other wind results do not include<br>the sub-model) as topographic location data is often not precise enough for point validation, especially where locations<br>are peaks or ridges (i.e. flat ridge can be extracted as a 45◦<br>north face even on a 25 m DEM, e.g. Fisher et al., 2004).<br>This station was chosen for its position on a large slope well<br>represented at the DEM resolution.<br>For LW↓ (9 stations) there are clear improvements over<br>GRID with REF and TopoSCALE due to high dependence<br>on T . To isolate this affect, we performed an additional test<br>where the Pirazzini model used in REF was driven with<br>TopoSCALE T and Rh to assess how well the emissivity<br>based part of the TopoSCALE approach performed over the<br>parameterisations employed in REF. This gave results of<br>R = 0.88 and RMSE = 27.9, suggesting that the larger part<br>of the improvement given by the TopoSCALE approach was<br>due to the improved description of emissivity at grid-level.<br>Overall, TopoSCALE gives an improved result over REF<br>both when REF is driven by lapse derived T and Rh and<br>TopoSCALE derived T and Rh.

Best RMSE performance is seen in clear-sky conditions due to removal of a large proportion of cloud-based<br>uncertainty. However, BIAS is higher in clear-sky conditions due to residual elevation effects affecting the larger<br>direct beam component. TopoSCALE reduces this BIAS by<br>around 3.5 Wm−2<br>as well as improving the RMSE score by<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci. Model Dev., 7, 387–405, 2014<br>396 J. Fiddes and S.

Two problems encountered in the analysis. (a) Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series i.e period 1999–<br>2001 and 2005–2009. Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted<br>to a three year period (1996–1998) that was stable. (b) A common<br>problem with climate models is a low number of dry days which is<br>compensated for by too high frequency and low intensity precipitation. The percentage dry days of OBS is much higher and distribution not even overlapping that of GRID data (IMIS-Data© 2013,<br>SLF).<br>5 Wm−2<br>. BIAS is also reduced under all-sky conditions by<br>TopoSCALE but more modestly and RMSE score is roughly<br>equal. This indicates that TopoSCALE improves the direct<br>beam component most as corrections focus on this part of<br>the radiation budget. In a separate analysis the Erbs partitioning scheme for direct and diffuse SW↓ was tested.<br>As expected the partitioning scheme adds some uncertainty<br>(i.e. R reduced from 0.88 to 0.81/0.75under all-sky conditions). Results for direct/diffuse are negatively/positively<br>biased (−20.4/17.2 %). Full details are not given here as<br>this topic is well covered in the literature (e.g. Erbs et al.,<br>1982; Ruiz-Arias et al., 2010a). Despite high uncertainty introduced in decomposition models, the reaggregation of solar<br>components after elevation/terrain correction minimizes the<br>potential effects in the final terrain corrected estimates (RuizArias et al., 2010a).<br>Two quantities are important in modelling precipitation,<br>quantity and frequency, the former representing total inputs<br>and the second controlling distribution of those inputs over<br>a given period of time. Figure 7 shows a common problem<br>with climate model precipitation fields – that is “constant<br>drizzle” (i.e. a low number of dry days which is compensated for by high frequency and low intensity precipitation)<br>(Piani et al., 2009; Manders et al., 2012). The percentage dry<br>days of OBS is much higher (and not even overlapping) that<br>of ERA-I GRID data. This cannot be changed by the current scheme as precipitation can not be created (to be conservative), but only distributed to the subgrid according to the<br>scheme. A conservative approach would require a temporal<br>redistribution of precipitation as opposed to the spatial corrections we apply in this study. Figure 8 shows that both REF<br>and TopoSCALE improve the distribution of monthly precipitation totals, especially high intensity events accounting for<br>approximately 50 % of mass inputs (central grey line in the<br>0 200 400 600 800<br>0.000 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008<br>Monthly Precipitation [mm/month]<br>Density<br>VAL<br>GRID<br>REF<br>TOPOSCALE<br>OBS<br>Fig. 8.

The dominant effect is from the lapse rate as both<br>REF and TopoSCALE distributions are reasonably similar.<br>Figure 9b gives monthly and annual totals for all eligible stations in the OBS data set. The improvement of TopoSCALE<br>with the inclusion of the spatial component over REF (purely<br>lapse-rate based), is evident with improved R, RMSE and<br>BIAS scores. Figure 9 also highlights the improved simulation of both extremes.<br>5.3 Diurnal cycles<br>The diurnal cycle in surface and boundary-layer variables is<br>important for the global climate system (Dai and Trenberth,<br>2004), and particularly in simulating daily variation in the<br>surface energy balance. Figure 10 shows the diurnal cycle<br>of SW↓ and T , two fields characterised by distinctive diurnal cycles, in order to investigate the performance of the<br>scheme at sub-daily timescales. Additionally these fields represent surface (SW↓) and pressure-level (T ) fields. We calculated the average of all 03:00–00:00 UTC 3 h time steps<br>over the entire study period for months of December and<br>June. A subset of OBS stations is presented, representing<br>an elevation range of 370–3580 m a.s.l. In general, the diurnal cycle of SW↓ appears to be well reproduced by ERA-I.<br>However, seasonal differences are apparent with more accurate simulation in June than December as indicated by the<br>full range of values at 12:00 UTC being more comprehensively represented. Lower amplitudes of diurnal cycles in T<br>make the analysis less clear. In December, diurnal cycles are<br>quite strongly smoothed at low elevation whereas cycles are<br>Geosci.

In<br>June there is a degree of smoothing at low elevations but<br>cycles are generally reproduced. However, at high elevation<br>there is a very strong smoothing. Where TopoSCALE performs less well for T (i.e. winter and high elevation) is likely<br>related to poor representation of surface boundary layer in<br>ERA-I data (cf. Sect. 6.3).<br>5.4 Seasonal error<br>Figure 11 gives boxplots of deviation of daily values of MOD<br>from OBS, as defined above and grouped according to month<br>of the year in order to investigate seasonal patterns in the error signature. No averaging is performed, all daily mean values are considered. Results for T suggests that TopoSCALE<br>is too warm in winter and too cold in summer. The median<br>and the majority of the 25–75 % quantile lie within a 1◦<br>error<br>margin. The boxplot for Rh shows that TopoSCALE greatly<br>reduces the seasonal error signal over both REF and GRID.<br>There is an almost constant small negative bias throughout<br>the year. If a bias correction were applied the 25–75 % quantiles would lie within a 10 % (referring to the unit of Rh) error<br>margin. Results for Ws shows the strong bias correction by<br>TopoSCALE throughout the year with slightly poorer performance in spring. Results for LW↓ show a negligible seasonal pattern in GRID, REF and TopoSCALE. TopoSCALE<br>has a lower magnitude of error. Both REF and TopoSCALE<br>show slightly larger errors in April and May (but with opposing sign). Results for SW↓ show negative bias for both<br>all-sky and clear-sky conditions. This effect is strongest in<br>spring/summer, possibly due to higher magnitudes of values.<br>The TopoSCALE correction is most evident under clear-sky<br>conditions in autumn/winter.<br>5.5 Elevation effects<br>Figure 12 shows the daily mean error of GRID, REF and<br>TopoSCALE results (MOD) with respect to OBS as a function of relative elevation of station (e.g. station elevation –<br>grid elevation). Each box may contain multiple stations as<br>long as they share the same elevation difference from their<br>respective ERA-I grid cell. The plot is binned into 400 m intervals (300 m for radiation). This analysis was performed to<br>investigate any elevation dependency of the error signal as<br>well as to look at the effect of the different methods implemented in the ERA-I model to compute variables on pressure<br>levels above and below the model surface (cf. Sect. 2.2). The<br>red box represents surface data (grid-level ±200 m) in order<br>to investigate the relative performance gain/loss close to the<br>grid-surface. This may point to suitability of TopoSCALE<br>outside of mountain areas.<br>The results for T show larger error for stations below grid<br>(RMSE = 2.46) than above (RMSE = 1.60). This result is<br>also slightly negatively biased. This shows that the extrapolation of data below grid level produces a poorer result<br>and only slightly better than REF. The fact that observations tend to be colder indicates that non-represented subgrid effects, such as inversions, could be significant in driving this bias. Above grid level there are large improvements<br>over REF and GRID. REF shows the expected result that<br>error related to lapse-rate-based approaches increases with<br>the distance over which they are applied. The Rh plot shows<br>that TopoSCALE is increasing positively/negatively biased<br>with distance above/below grid level as compared to REF.<br>However the absolute magnitude of error is much lower. Ws<br>bias in GRID error signature is corrected by TopoSCALE (albeit slightly overcompensated above grid). TopoSCALE performs better below grid level, possibly due to lower absolute<br>Ws magnitudes leading to lower error values.<br>Looking only at surface data (red-box), pressure-levelbased results (i.e. TopoSCALE) outperform surface databased results (i.e. GRID and REF) in all cases but most significantly in T and Ws. This is quite surprising as it would<br>seem likely that the surface data should contain more of the<br>boundary layer effect (cf. Sect. 6.3). However, this indicates<br>that TopoSCALE could also be usefully applied in locations<br>close to grid level without reduced quality over surface-based<br>data.<br>6 Discussion<br>Reanalyses are complex products in that they combine a climate model with observations. This section provides a discussion of key issues relevant to the use of reanalysis and<br>other climate data sets, in order to place this study and results<br>in context, as well as to highlight some important limitations<br>to this approach.<br>6.1 Assimilation issues<br>Reanalyses assimilate a large number of observations in spatially and temporally varying quantities and densities. It is<br>therefore important to know which observational data sets<br>are assimilated into the ERA-I product, as this not only affects how independent observations are in terms of validation, but will also suggest how the performance of ERA-I<br>(and therefore TopoSCALE) can vary with observation density. Assimilated data that is also used for evaluation in this<br>study originates from the SYNOP registered MeteoSchweiz<br>stations (a subset of the ANETZ network), and only affects<br>observations of air temperature and relative humidity (Table 1). Furthermore, for screen-level analysis (2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity) surface observations that differ<br>by more that 300 m from the model orography are rejected in<br>the ERA-I assimilation.<br>6.2 Bias and spatial-temporal variability of errors<br>LSM results are sensitive to bias in climate data (e.g. Berg,<br>2003), which may result in unrealistic estimates of mass,<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Performance of TopoSCALE precipitation at monthly and annual scales compared to GRID and REF. The description of the spatial<br>distribution of precipitation included in TopoSCALE gives improvements over a purely lapse-rate-based approach (REF).<br>energy, momentum exchanges between the atmosphere and<br>surface (Maurer et al., 2001a, b). Therefore, bias correction<br>is usually regarded as a crucial step in providing accurate<br>driving fields to a land-surface or impact model (Hagemann<br>et al., 2011). In this study we have chosen to conceptually<br>separate “bias” and “scale” (often combined in downscaling routines based on station data) in order to focus on the<br>problem of topography-based scaling, as this is not reliant<br>on observational data sets. Therefore, the treatment of bias<br>can be performed in a second step with a reduced influence<br>of scale differences. However, we acknowledge that bias correction is often necessary to provide accurate fields to surface<br>models. Reanalysis can be seen as an imperfect model combined with incomplete data and output should not be equated<br>with “observations” or “reality”. The changing mix of observations, and biases in observations and models, can introduce spurious variability and trends into reanalysis output. Observational constraints, and therefore reanalysis reliability, can vary considerably depending on the location,<br>time-period, and variable considered. Another problem is<br>that mixing observations with models tends to violate conservation laws. Most significant to this study is the fact that<br>reanalysis will likely be closer to reality at locations with<br>higher observation densities (i.e Europe and specifically the<br>European Alps, in contrast to other high-mountain regions).<br>6.3 Subgrid issues and boundary-layer effects<br>Due to the coarse resolution of current reanalysis data sets<br>(typically 0.75 ◦–1.5 ◦<br>), various processes are unresolved by<br>the model. An important example is temperature inversion<br>in mountain valleys, which will not be captured by the data.<br>Another important process is local-scale rain shadows caused<br>by unresolved topographic barriers and shallow convection<br>which is parameterised by a bulk mass flux scheme in the<br>ECWMF model (Tiedtke, 1989), and therefore cannot resolve the level of spatial differentiation that is present in surface measurements. The surface boundary layer (as opposed<br>atmospheric boundary layer) will have a residual effect upon<br>surface measurements, which will not necessarily be present<br>Geosci.

TopoSCALE given by solid line, OBS given by dashed line.<br>in pressure levels representing the free atmosphere. For example, turbulent exchanges of sensible heat fluxes can be<br>a significant contributor to energy exchange between surface<br>and atmosphere (Cline, 1997; Helgason and Pomeroy, 2012).<br>These effects will also likely affect diurnal cycles of observations. However, the magnitude of these effects is not quantified by this study.<br>7 Conclusions<br>This study has proposed a method that can efficiently provide<br>meteorological variables to an LSM operating at high resolution in complex terrain. In addition, it provides a means to<br>generate driving data in remote areas due to non-reliance on<br>measurements. The schemes focus is on variables that can<br>be derived from pressure-level data, however, surface fields<br>are also computed in order to provide a consistent set of<br>driving meteorology required by an LSM. Important limitations of the approach are described in Sect. 6 but can be<br>summarised as related to (1) assimilation issues (i.e. possible reduction in performance in data-poor areas), (2) reduced<br>performance below grid-level (although this is not universal in gridded data sets), (3) bias in gridded climate data,<br>and (4) subgrid phenomena that are not resolved by the input data (such as temperature inversions). Specifically, in<br>terms of variables computed in this study, strong improvements in the subgrid radiation scheme would likely result<br>from the availability of radiative fluxes (LW↓, SW↓<br>dir and<br>SW↓<br>dif) on pressure levels. The benefit of such an improved<br>description of vertical profiles and diffuse/direct partitioning<br>would be of great relevance as large areas globally are subject to rugged topography (cf. Gruber, 2012; Körner et al.,<br>2011; Meybeck et al., 2001). As an outlook, partitioned SW↓<br>components are now archived in the current ECWMF operational model (ECWMF, personal communication, 2012), so<br>will likely be available in future generations of reanalysis,<br>but possibly only at the surface. Precipitation could be improved by a more rigorous sub-model such as that proposed<br>by, for example, Smith and Barstad (2004). We attempt to<br>account for subgrid orographic effects such as rain-shadows<br>by implementing a description of variability through a climatology, but this is dependent on the quality of the climatology data set. However, the next generation of reanalysis (e.g. ERA-20C) are likely to deliver large improvements<br>in this respect due to higher model resolutions improving<br>the representation of orographic precipitation. Additionally,<br>when used with RCM (e.g. CORDEX, the first globally integrated RCM project) or weather model it is expected that<br>precipitation-based error would be reduced significantly. In<br>sum, the core strengths of the scheme we have described in<br>this study are the following:<br>1. Generally demonstrates improved skill in downscaling<br>climate data in complex terrain, as compared to reference methods and good performance when evaluated<br>against measurements. This result is most pronounced<br>in pressure-level variables.<br>2. Provides a means to generate downscaled data when<br>statistical methods are not possible i.e. in remote, datapoor areas or future time-periods.<br>3. Provides spatially and temporally continuous meteorological fields at point-scale which are physically consistent.<br>4. Is efficient and therefore can be used to derive long<br>time series or data over large areas.<br>However, it is recognised that this method has been developed and tested in a particular climatic zone (temperate,<br>moist) and requires testing elsewhere to determine broader<br>suitability.<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

Discuss.: 26 June 2013<br>Revised: 6 November 2013 – Accepted: 30 December 2013 – Published: 21 February 2014<br>Abstract. Simulation of land surface processes is problematic in heterogeneous terrain due to the the high resolution<br>required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability<br>caused by, for example, topography, and the lack of accurate<br>meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required.<br>Gridded data products produced by atmospheric models can<br>fill this gap, however, often not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations. In this study we<br>describe a method that uses the well-resolved description<br>of the atmospheric column provided by climate models, together with high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs),<br>to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a fine-scale<br>subgrid. The main aim of this approach is to provide highresolution driving data for a land-surface model (LSM).<br>The method makes use of an interpolation of pressurelevel data according to topographic height of the subgrid.<br>An elevation and topography correction is used to downscale short-wave radiation. Long-wave radiation is downscaled by deriving a cloud-component of all-sky emissivity<br>at grid level and using downscaled temperature and relative<br>humidity fields to describe variability with elevation. Precipitation is downscaled with a simple non-linear lapse and optionally disaggregated using a climatology approach.<br>We test the method in comparison with unscaled grid-level<br>data and a set of reference methods, against a large evaluation<br>dataset (up to 210 stations per variable) in the Swiss Alps.<br>We demonstrate that the method can be used to derive meteorological inputs in complex terrain, with most significant<br>improvements (with respect to reference methods) seen in<br>variables derived from pressure levels: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and incoming long-wave radiation.<br>This method may be of use in improving inputs to numerical simulations in heterogeneous and/or remote terrain, especially when statistical methods are not possible, due to lack<br>of observations (i.e. remote areas or future periods).<br>1 Introduction<br>Simulations of land-surface processes are important for performing assessments of a wide range of earth systems, under current and possible future climates. This task is problematic in complex terrain due to the inter-connected problems of (i) the high resolution required of model grids to<br>capture strong lateral variability caused by, for example, topography, surface or sub-surface processes (e.g. Gubler et al.,<br>2011; Riseborough et al., 2008; Arnold and Rees, 2009); and<br>consequently, (ii) the lack of accurate meteorological forcing data at the site or scale it is required (Thornton et al.,<br>1997; Liston and Elder, 2006). This can be due to the lack of<br>meteorological observations (i.e. spatial coverage, temporal<br>extent/continuity, or variables measured are insufficient for<br>purpose) or lack of representative observations where surface variability is high. Gridded data products produced by<br>atmospheric models can, in part, fill this gap (e.g. Frauenfeld, 2005; Pereira-Cardenal et al., 2011; Akhtar et al., 2009;<br>Vu et al., 2012); however, in many cases not at an appropriate spatial resolution to drive land-surface simulations (i.e.<br>site scale), and therefore require some form of downscaling<br>of variables.<br>Basic downscaling approaches (also referred to as disaggregation), utilise fixed relationships between the coarsegrid fields of atmospheric models and a subgrid surface,<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>388 J. Fiddes and S. Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain<br>that describes a given variable at higher resolution than the<br>coarse-grid. Such approaches developed from the recognised<br>need to represent subgrid surface heterogeneity in climate<br>models and therefore the requirement to disaggregate the<br>coarse-grid climate forcing to the subgrid land-surface (e.g.<br>Dickinson et al., 1986; Wood, 1992; Koster and Suarez,<br>1992; Seth et al., 1994). For example, Giorgi et al. (2003)<br>and Dimri (2009) downscale the temperature field according<br>to the subgrid elevation and a fixed lapse rate. In a coupled<br>system it is important that the coarse-grid mean is conserved<br>by such approaches (Giorgi et al., 2003). More complex approaches to downscaling of climate data can be broadly divided into dynamical or statistical methods (Schmidli et al.,<br>2007) which are used to increase the resolution of largescale climate fields (see for full discussion Wilby and Wigley<br>(1997)). Dynamical methods achieve this by using a limited<br>area model at a higher grid resolution e.g. a regional climate model (RCM), to simulate fine-scale processes which<br>are consistent with large-scale climate fields (Giorgi, 2006).<br>While an RCM grid resolution could be increased further, in<br>practice the effective resolution is limited by the complexity<br>of the numerics that must be solved at each model time step,<br>to the order of 101 km (Kotlarski and Block, 2005). Statistical<br>methods derive empirical relationships between large-scale<br>predictor fields and local observations (Maraun and Wetterhall, 2010). These methods are computationally efficient<br>but the coverage and effective resolution is often limited by<br>the density of observations, especially in mountainous (i.e.<br>data-poor) areas. Additionally, it is unknown whether empirically derived relationships are valid outside the time window used for calibration. To compliment these approaches<br>there is a growing number of physically inspired, computationally efficient approaches that use physical relationships<br>and high-resolution surface information, that is, digital elevation models (DEMs), to distribute fine-scale forcings (meteorological stations or coarse-grid centre point) over wide<br>areas (e.g. Liston and Elder, 2006; Tarboton and Luce, 1996;<br>Marks et al., 1999; Jarosch et al., 2012). These distributed<br>forcings can then be used for full 2-D, point scale or lumped<br>model simulations.<br>Another interesting statistical approach presented by<br>Schomburg et al. (2012) utilises empirical relationships between the atmospheric coarse field and high-resolution surface data to disaggregate variables. The main aim of this<br>work was to improve the forcing of soil–vegetation transfer<br>models either in offline simulations or fully coupled model<br>systems. However, the emphasis of this work is on improving the representation of the land surface, via a distributed<br>forcing, within climate models; moreover, the scheme resolution of 400 m would be too coarse to resolve many surface<br>processes in mountain areas.<br>In complex terrain, topography-based gradients of meteorological variables (i.e. related to elevation, aspect, slope,<br>etc.) can often dominate over horizontal gradients (i.e. latitude/longitude) within a region that is of comparable size<br>to a typical coarse climate cell (e.g. 50–100 km). An example of a method that has successfully encoded this assumption is the PRISM framework (parameter–elevation regressions on independent slopes model) which provides a statistical, topography-based mapping of climate observations<br>(Daly et al., 1994, 2002). We do not neglect the fact that<br>other forms of heterogeneity may be important in modifying surface fluxes, such as surface cover, but it is important<br>to distinguish between surface heterogeneity that clearly affects atmospheric forcing, e.g. the effect of elevation on air<br>temperature, and those characteristics that become important<br>when performing a coupled land-surface–atmosphere simulation (e.g. the effect of soil properties on near-surface air<br>temperature).<br>Climate models provide spatially and temporally continuous fields which are physically consistent and therefore are<br>useful tools for forcing regional-scale land-surface studies<br>(Machguth et al., 2009; Kotlarski et al., 2010). In addition,<br>they provide a thorough description of the atmospheric column by providing data fields at many pressure levels between<br>the earth’s surface and top of the atmosphere.<br>The aim of this study is to develop methods that use<br>the well-resolved description of the atmospheric column<br>provided by climate models, together with high-resolution<br>DEMs, to downscale coarse-grid climate variables to a finescale subgrid. The main motivation of this approach is to provide high-resolution driving data for a land-surface model<br>(LSM), understood here as any process-based surface model<br>that simulates the interface of the land surface/subsurface–<br>atmosphere system. Additionally, the approach should be<br>consistent (methodologically, spatially, temporally) and not<br>reliant on observations. Therefore, the design criteria for this<br>method are (1) it provides high-resolution (< 100 m) downscaling of climate data based primarily on DEM-based information; (2) it is as physically based as possible and therefore has minimal reliance on observations and likely remains<br>valid under future conditions; (3) it employs simple methods<br>which are computationally efficient; (4) it may be used as<br>part of a modelling chain with a lumped representation of the<br>subgrid domain (e.g. Fiddes and Gruber, 2012) for large area<br>applications, as well as 1-D points and 2-D grids. Our approach therefore largely assumes vertical gradients to dominate horizontal gradients within a given model grid box. In<br>this study, we describe this method and its application with<br>ERA-Interim data, a 4-D-VAR reanalysis (3rd generation)<br>which uses the ECMWF climate model, although the method<br>could be equally used with other reanalyses (e.g. NARR,<br>NCEP/NCAR, JRA-55, NASA MERRA, or RCM derived<br>fields). Our methods are then evaluated against a large number of observations over a wide area of complex terrain in<br>the European Alps as well as compared to a set of reference<br>methods. The methods proposed here aim to provide an alternative to statistical methods when observations are not available (remote areas or future periods) and be complimentary<br>Geosci.

The ERA-Interim data assimilation system contains many improvements both in the forecasting model and<br>analysis methodology relative to ECMWF’s previous reanalysis, ERA-40, including the use of 4-dimensional variational analysis, a revised humidity analysis, the use of variational bias correction for satellite data, and other improvements in data handling (Dee et al., 2011). ERA-I provides<br>meteorological data from 1 January 1979 and continues to<br>be extended in near-real time. Gridded products include<br>a large variety of 3-hourly (00:00, 03:00, 06:00, 09:00, 12:00,<br>15:00, 18:00, and 21:00 UTC) grid-surface fields (GRID)<br>and 6-hourly (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC) upperatmosphere products available on 60 pressure levels (PL)<br>with top of the atmosphere located at 1 mb. ERA-I relies on<br>a 4-D-VAR system which uses observations within the windows of 15:00–03:00 UTC and 03:00–15:00 UTC (in the next<br>day) to initialise forecast simulations starting at 00:00 UTC<br>and 12:00 UTC, respectively. In order to allow sufficient<br>spin-up, the first nine hours of the forecast simulations are<br>not used. All fields used in this study where extracted on the<br>ECMWF reduced Gaussian N128 grid (0.75◦ × 0.75◦<br>). Six<br>PLs are used in this study covering the range of 1000–500 mb<br>(1000, 925, 850, 775, 650, 500), corresponding to approximately an elevation range of 150–5500 m a.s.l. ERA-I fields<br>used are listed in Table 1.<br>2.2 Pressure levels below model surface<br>While ERA-I model levels are computed from the model<br>orography surface to top of the atmosphere, pressure-level<br>data is given in the interval 1000 mb (approximately sealevel)–1 mb (top of atmosphere). This means that pressurelevel data exist below the model-grid surface in regions with<br>rugged topography. The extrapolation of fields below the surface uses different methods to those above the model surface. For example, geopotential is extrapolated below the<br>model surface as a function of surface geopotential, surface temperature, temperature at mean sea level, surface<br>pressure and pressure-level value. Temperature is extrapolated below the model surface to a given pressure level as<br>a quadratic function of surface temperature, surface pressure and pressure-level value. Wind and relative humidity are<br>both constant below model surface and equal to the lowest<br>model level values (ECMWF, 2011). Additionally a greater<br>quantity of data is assimilated from above surface observations. Therefore, it can be expected that there is a difference in quality of above/below grid pressure-level data. In<br>addition, measurement locations below grid level are more<br>likely to be in valleys and therefore there will be greater exposure of observations to subgrid processes, not represented<br>by the data. See ECMWF (2011) for full details of extrapolation methods. However, it is difficult to disentangle this effect<br>from the fact that measurements above the model surface are<br>more likely to represent the free atmosphere and, therefore,<br>be more accurately simulated than those strongly effected by<br>topographic effects (e.g. Mesinger et al., 2006; Jarosch et al.,<br>2012) such as inversion layers or topographically modified<br>wind fields. This issue is addressed in the results section.<br>2.3 Evaluation data sets<br>See Table 1 for an overview (by variable) of the evaluation<br>(OBS) data sets used in this study. The MeteoSwiss automatic meteorological network (ANETZ) covers 40 stations<br>(hourly data) ranging 1132–3580 m a.s.l. and represents both<br>high mountain locations and valleys. The IMIS station network of the Swiss Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research<br>is biased towards high alpine locations (there are few valley<br>stations) but represents topographical heterogeneity in terms<br>of slope and aspect more comprehensively than ANETZ stations. Network elevation range is 1562–3341 m a.s.l. Tenminute measurements from the Alpine Surface Radiation<br>Budget network (ASRB) (Marty et al., 2002) network has<br>9 stations ranging 370–3580 m a.s.l. All OBS data sources<br>where aggregated to daily mean values to enable comparison with ERA-I fields at a common resolution. An additional<br>analysis on diurnal cycles required aggregation at 3-hourly<br>time steps. See Fig. 1 for the locations all stations used in<br>this study and elevation distribution of stations by variable.<br>See Sect. 6.1 for assimilation issues related to evaluation data<br>sets.<br>2.4 Precipitation climatology<br>The CRU Alpine precipitation data set (hereafter referred to<br>as CRU) is used as a climatology in the precipitation scheme.<br>It provides monthly precipitation totals, for the period 1800–<br>2003, gridded at 10 arc-min resolution over the Alpine region. The data set is based on 192 long-term homogenized<br>precipitation series from meteorological stations across the<br>study domain and a high-resolution precipitation climatology for the period 1971–1990. Full details are available in<br>Efthymiadis et al. (2006).<br>2.5 Data quality control<br>OBS values outside acceptable limits were removed automatically by applying physically plausible thresholds to all<br>data sets.

Input pressure-level fields used are, air temperature (Tpl), relative humidity (Rhpl), wind components U and<br>V , which are converted to wind speed (Wspl). Input gridsurface fields are downwelling global radiation (SW↓grid),<br>downwelling long-wave radiation (LW↓grid) and precipitation (Pgrid).

Methods for describing a SUB<br>simulation point used in this study: (a) grid level data (TGRID),<br>(b) extrapolated grid data by reference methods (TSUB(REF)) and<br>(c) TopoSCALE interpolated pressure-level data (TSUB(TSCALE)).<br>modified wind fields can be additionally computed according<br>to a simple wind sub-model (Liston and Sturm, 1998) which<br>adjusts the speeds and directions according to topographic<br>slope and curvature relationships. To perform the wind modification calculations, the local slope, aspect, and topographic<br>curvature (a measure of relative prominence with respect to<br>surrounding terrain) are required (Appendix C2).<br>3.1.2 Radiative fluxes<br>LW↓sub is computed by deriving a cloud component of allsky emissivity at grid level and using Tsub, Rhsub to describe variability with elevation. First, clear-sky emissivity<br>at SUB (<br>cl<br>sub) and GRID (<br>cl<br>grid) are computed according to<br>Konzelmann et al. (1994):<br><br>cl<br>sub/grid = 0.23 + x1(pVsub/grid/Tsub/grid)<br>1/x2<br>, (1)<br>where x1 = 0.43 and x2 = 5.7 (Gubler et al., 2012) and water vapour pressure, pV is a function of Rh (Appendix C3).<br>The all-sky emissivity is computed at GRID using LW↓grid<br>and the Stefan–Boltzmann equation:<br><br>as<br>grid = LW ↓grid /σ T 4<br>grid, (2)<br>where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant of 5.67 ×<br>10−8<br>Js−1 m−2 K<br>−4<br>. We estimate the cloud-based component of emissivity (1) at GRID though subtraction of <br>cl<br>grid<br>from <br>as<br>grid in order to apply this correction directly at SUB.<br>Finally, LW ↓sub can be computed accounting for elevation<br>changes in T and Rh by<br>LW ↓sub=<br><br><br>cl<br>sub + 1<br>σ T 4<br>sub. (3)<br>This approach assumes that cloud emissivity at GRID and<br>SUB elevations are the same, but accounts for reduction of<br>clear-sky emissivity with elevation. This is important as the<br>steepest gradients in LW↓ are often found in clear-sky conditions due to reduction in atmospheric water vapour with<br>elevation. After elevation correction, terrain effects are accounted for by reduction of LW↓sub by multiplication with<br>the sky-view factor, being the fraction of sky that is visible at<br>SUB (Vd). This assumes that LW↓ is isotropic.<br>SW↓sub is computed in a three-step process: (1) partitioning of SW↓grid into direct and diffuse components, (2) elevation adjustment of direct, and (3) topographic correction of<br>both diffuse and direct at point scale. SW↓grid can be partitioned into direct (SW↓<br>dir<br>grid) and and diffuse (SW↓<br>dif<br>grid) components according to the hourly regression model of RuizArias et al. (2010b) which has been developed based on 21<br>stations in Europe and USA (Appendix ). This method uses<br>the clearness index, which is computed by ratioing SW↓grid<br>against irradiance at top of atmosphere, SW↓toa and in doing<br>so estimates a solar transmissivity of the atmospheric column (Fig. 3a). It should be noted that the regression model<br>was developed on hourly data, whereas we apply it to 3 h<br>averages. The vertical gradient of global irradiance between<br>GRID and SUB is mainly determined by the direct component together with difference in the optical path length 1m,<br>assuming that attenuative properties of the atmosphere are<br>constant between the two elevations. Therefore, we apply an<br>elevation correction to SW↓<br>dir<br>grid only, largely following methods of Ruiz-Arias et al. (2010b) (Fig. 3b). First, 1m is computed as<br>1m = 1z cos θz, (4)<br>where 1z is difference in elevation and θz is the solar zenith<br>angle. We can then solve the Beer–Lambert law for direct<br>irradiance to obtain the broadband attenuation coefficient (k):<br>SW ↓<br>dir= SW ↓<br>toa e<br>−km, (5)<br>where m = 1/cos θz (except for large values of θz). The difference in SW↓<br>dir due to elevation difference between GRID<br>and SUB can then be found as<br>1SW ↓<br>dir<br>SW ↓dir ≈ 1 − e<br>−k1z cos θz<br>. (6)<br>Equation (6) shows direct irradiance should increase exponentially with elevation given constant k and elevation-based<br>change in irradiance is maximum when sun is at zenith and<br>zero when sun is at horizon. As the correction is only applicable to clear-sky conditions, it is applied when the air-masscorrected clearness index kt<br>is greater than 0.65 (Perez et al.,<br>1990).<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/387/2014/ Geosci.

This is achieved by computing the illumination angle i, which is the angle the incident direct beam makes with<br>the slope normal and varies with solar zenith θ0 and azimuth<br>angles φ0, and local slope angle S and aspect A:<br>cosisub = cos θz cosS + sinθz sinS cos(φ0 − A).

(8)<br>Additionally, cast-shadows and self-shadowing effects are<br>often important in complex terrain and are accounted for<br>through local horizon elevations.

Gruber: TopoSCALE: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain 393<br>3.1.3 Precipitation<br>Precipitation patterns in mountain regions are driven by<br>a range of complex mechanisms which depend upon, for<br>example, season, geographical climate (maritime, continental) and structure of orography (Leung and Ghan, 1995;<br>Lundquist et al., 2010; Smith and Barstad, 2004). Precipitation is therefore strongly variable in both time and space.<br>Figure 4 gives an overview of the combined climatology and<br>lapse rate approach used to address this problem (e.g. Früh<br>et al., 2006). It should be noted that this routine can also be<br>implemented using only the lapse rate, in order to remove<br>any dependency on climatology data. We acknowledge that<br>the quality of the data set is heavily dependent on density of<br>observations and therefore, better than average results should<br>be expected in our study domain.<br>First, the elevation signal of the climatology data is removed by dividing by the non-linear lapse rate (λp) of Liston<br>and Elder (2006) (Appendix C5), and then normalising to<br>the GRID reference elevation. Pgrid is then disaggregated according to the subgrid variability as described by the normalised climatology (now elevation independent). Each of<br>the ith (in this study 1–25) climatology grid-cells Pclim are<br>normalised by the sum of Pclim contained in each ERA<br>course grid box, resulting in a subgrid disaggregation factor<br>Wsub,<br>Wsub = P<br>i<br>clim /<br>XPclim. (11)<br>In this study we use the CRU climatology but other sources<br>of subgrid observations could be used. Globally, or near globally available data sets (gauge and satellite based) include the<br>Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (Huffman et al., 2007),<br>Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (Beck et al., 2005)<br>and Climatic Research Unit (New et al., 2002) or regionally available such as PRISM (Daly et al., 1994) or even<br>direct observations if available. The product of Pgrid and<br>Wsub generates a subgrid distribution of precipitation at the<br>climatology resolution, that is conservative of the coarsegrid forcing Pgrid. Finally, λp is applied to capture fine-scale<br>precipitation-elevation gradients in order to obtain Psub,<br>Psub = Pgrid · Wsub · λp. (12)<br>It should be noted that this method simply applies a scaling<br>to the precipitation field and does not estimate the precipitation phase (snow–rain partition), this is done by the model<br>which the precipitation field is used to drive.<br>3.2 Reference methods<br>The following is a description of the reference parameterisations with which we compare the current scheme. We do not<br>intend this comparison to be exhaustive, but to merely serve<br>as a reference point, based on common parameterisations.<br>Tgrid is simply extrapolated according to a fixed lapse of<br>6.5 ◦C km−1<br>(e.g. Blandford et al., 2008). Rh is not a linear<br>function of elevation and so the relatively linear dew point<br>temperature (Td) is often used (Liston and Elder, 2006). Rh<br>can be converted to Td as a function of T and pV. In this<br>study Tdgrid is available, so this step is unnecessary.<br>Tdsub can be computed using a variable lapse rate (Kunkel,<br>1989):<br>lapse = λ · c/b, (13)<br>where λ is a vapour pressure coefficient that varies during<br>each month of the year (Kunkel, 1989) and constants b =<br>22.452, c = 272.55 ◦C are given by Buck (1981). Finally,<br>Tdsub is then converted back to Rhsub as a function of Tsub.<br>LW↓ is parameterised as a function of T and pV and cloud<br>cover according to the clear-sky formula of Konzelmann<br>et al. (1994) (Eq. 1) and the all-sky formula of Pirazzini et al.<br>(2000) while accounting for Vd,<br>LW ↓= <br>cl(1 − N<br>p1<br>) +<br><br><br>asN<br>p2<br><br>σ T 4<br>, (14)<br>where <br>cl is given by Eq. (1), N is given by the ERA-I total<br>cloud product (0–1), p1 = 6, p2 = 4 and <br>as = 0.979. Wind<br>is adjusted by 40 % per km (i.e increased above grid level<br>reduced below grid level) (Plüss, 1997). SW↓ is not compared to a reference method as the methods (i.e. partitioning,<br>elevation and topographic correction) used in this study are<br>commonly used elsewhere (i.e. Oliphant, 2003; Schroeder<br>et al., 2009). Precipitation is scaled with a non-linear lapse<br>rate (Liston and Elder, 2006).<br>4 Experiments<br>4.1 Location<br>The study region contains the entire Swiss Alps and uses 19<br>ERA-I grid boxes to cover all observations that are used to<br>evaluate the methods. Switzerland contains one of the most<br>densely observed mountain regions in the world and, therefore, is a suitable region within which to evaluate this method<br>and specifically its performance with respect to vertical information, as it covers a large elevation gradient of 195–<br>4634 m a.s.l. (Fig. 1).<br>4.2 Set-up<br>The experimental strategy is as follows: results of the current methods (TopoSCALE) are compared to (1) unscaled<br>grid level ERA-I fields (GRID) and (2) reference methods<br>(REF), where appropriate.

A density plot is used because of the large<br>number of points plotted (e.g. ∼ 106<br>in the case of T ).<br>For T , (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant<br>improvement in R, RMSE and BIAS of T with respect<br>to observations. Applying a fixed lapse rate (REF) improves the RMSE by 0.75 ◦C over grid level values whereas<br>TopoSCALE improves RMSE by 2.66 ◦C. The BIAS in REF<br>(1.5) is similar to GRID (1.62), whereas TopoSCALE significantly improves this (−0.02). Bias in TopoSCALE is concentrated at extremes of temperature (i.e. low temperatures<br>are too high and high temperatures are too low).<br>For Rh (210 stations), TopoSCALE gives a significant improvement in the correlation and modest improvement in<br>RMSE (due to the poorly performing cluster at high humidity). There appears to be a high degree of uncertainty in saturated conditions (i.e. measurements at or close to 100 %) in<br>all cases. TopoSCALE shows significant improvement over<br>GRID and REF (approximately the same performance) particular in the interval 0–60 % which is significant for processes such as sublimation which occur in dry atmospheric<br>conditions. Both GRID and REF seem unable to represent<br>humidities less than 30 %. This could possibly be that dry<br>(often well below 30% humidity) Foehn winds are represented in the pressure-level data but absent from surface data.<br>Several discontinuities were observed in the wind time series that are possibly related to changing patterns of data<br>assimilation (Fig. 7a). At least one of these artefacts fits<br>to a major data introduction (European wind profilers in<br>2002). Therefore, the wind analysis was restricted to a three<br>year period (1996–1998) that was stable. Comparison of<br>distributions of wind speed show a large improvement of<br>TopoSCALE over GRID especially in the R value and BIAS.<br>There is still a large degree of scatter especially at high wind<br>speeds. The most significant result is an improvement in<br>BIAS with a shift of the distribution to the 1 : 1 line, while<br>the GRID data is not able to represent values greater than<br>5 ms−1<br>.<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●●<br>●<br>●<br>● ● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>● ●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●<br>●
