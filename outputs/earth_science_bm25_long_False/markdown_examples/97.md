# Query `97`

## Original Question

*Reviewing market regulatory standards I came across the problem of finding a source that I could cite of concise, worldwide accepted industry geophysical terms.

So far I know Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary, SEG Wiki, SPE PetroWiki that give some information on some terms. In practice I need something like this definition in SEG Wiki for seismic crooked lines. Although in this case I don't think the term is well defined.

I am looking for a worldwide industry accepted glossary that I could rely on and cite. The broader it is the best will be for having less problems in future. Where would be the best place to find such source of information? Any other suggestions will be welcome.

It sends photons out in pretty much every direction at random, like this:<br><br>But the Sun is far away from Earth. Most of those photons don't reach the Earth because they're heading in the wrong direction. Only those photons that happen to be heading toward the Earth actually get there - and the photons that are heading to the Earth are all heading in more or less the same direction. So the photons that actually reach the Earth are all travelling in more or less parallel directions.<br>Below I've drawn the photons that reach the Earth in red, and the other photons in grey. You can see that the red ones are more or less parallel. (In reality, the Earth is further away than that, so the photons are more parallel than in the diagram.)<br><br>To answer your last question: sunbeams are formed when a gap in the clouds lets some light through, like this:<br><br>Photons from the Sun are always travelling in more or less the same direction, because they all came from the Sun, but it's easier to notice this when the light is concentrated in one particular place like this.<br>Finally, we have to explain why you're able to see the beam at all. This is just because some of the photons in the beam collide with particles in the atmosphere, which scatter them in all directions, and some of these scattered photons happen to hit your eye.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Share<br><br><br>Cite<br><br><br>Improve this answer<br><br><br><br>                        Follow<br>                        <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>            answered Dec 30, 2014 at 2:03<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>N.

Diameter of earth is 12,742 km. The width of the photon cloud from the Sun is a small fraction of a millimeter [Extracted from the book "God does play dice with the universe" by Shan Gao]. Seeing these numbers in mm and km, I think, the second diagram seems to conclude wrong conclusions (though it is not to scale, scale might make a difference here).<br>$\endgroup$<br><br>– Sensebe<br><br>Dec 30, 2014 at 9:37<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>$\begingroup$<br>If we consider scale, earth will be bigger and bigger than photon cloud (which seems to be opposite in the diagram including earth and sun), then the angles between photons (which seems to be very very less in the diagram) makes more difference w.r.t earth, so, even now I have trouble in understanding your view (that photons will be parallel as seen in the clouds diagram), what I think is photons should come in criss-cross form. Finally, once again, thank you for the effort.<br>$\endgroup$<br><br>– Sensebe<br><br>Dec 30, 2014 at 9:45<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1<br><br><br><br><br>$\begingroup$<br>I'm not familiar with the reference you cite, and the term "photon cloud" is not standard terminology, so I can't say anything about its width. You're right that the incoming photons criss-cross each other, but the point is that they only do it a bit. (If they didn't criss-cross each other, you wouldn't be able to form an image of the sun using a pin-hole camera.) The photons' paths differ from each other by at most the Sun's apparent diameter in the sky, which is about half a degree, so they're pretty close to parallel, which is why you can see sunbeams as distinct lines.<br>$\endgroup$<br><br>– N.
