# Query `95`

## Original Question

*According to this article from 2015 How much oil is left on Earth

1.5 trillion barrels of crude oil reserves were left in the world by end 2015

But how much oil was already consumed worldwide since it was started to use massively in the mid 19th century? Is it most of it or a small part of it?

PS: I'm not sure if this question is for Earth Science SE or for Economy SE, if you think it's in the wrong SE please move it.*

It’s common to hear that electric vehicles are going to take over the motor vehicle market sometime soon and eliminate much of the demand for oil in the not-too-distant future.</p<br><pIn spite of those claims, which have been made for some years now, global oil consumption has risen at a rate of nearly 1 million barrels/day (mb/d) per year on average from 2000 to 2017.&nbsp; The U.S. Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration (US DOE/EIA or EIA) is predicting that global petroleum consumption (this includes all hydrocarbon liquids) will increase ~1.6 mb/d in 2018.&nbsp; In the U.S., petroleum consumption for 2017 will be approximately 20.2 mb/d or ~7.3-7.4 billion barrels/year, the most since 2007.</p<br><pThe argument for the takeover of the motor vehicle market by electric vehicles ignores the fact that the energy per unit mass of presently used lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles is less than 1/50<supth</sup that of gasoline or diesel fuel.&nbsp; Possibly there will be some improvement in lithium ion batteries in the future but not by a factor remotely close to 50.&nbsp; The much higher energy per unit mass for gasoline and diesel fuel provides a significant advantage for gasoline and diesel over lithium ion batteries, particularly in terms of hauling, towing and long-distance driving.</p<br><pTo compensate for the low energy per unit mass of lithium ion batteries in motor vehicles, exotic light weigh, and expensive, materials are used in the vehicles.&nbsp; For that reason, electric vehicles are expensive to make.</p<br><pAt present, auto companies subsidize the cost of electric vehicles through the sale of gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles.&nbsp; If they sell electric vehicles in large quantities, the subsidy would have to be removed so auto companies could make money on those sales.&nbsp; The federal government also presently provides a $7,500 tax credit to electric vehicle purchases although there has been talk of eliminating the tax credit by the current administration.</p<br><pAmericans were quite happy when the price of oil went down significantly in late 2014.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several reasons for the decline in the price of oil.&nbsp; One was the rapid development of fracking in U.S.&nbsp; A second reason was the large increase of oil production in Iraq, from 2.398 mb/d in 2010 to 4.050 mb/d in 2015 according to EIA data.</p<br><pU.S. oil production from fracking (light tight oil) increased by 3.933 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 (EIA). &nbsp;Global crude + condensate production increased 5.618 mb/d from 2010 to 2015 so the increase from U.S. light tight oil and Iraq, 5.585 mb/d, represented almost all of the global production increase.</p<br><pThe increase for U.S. light tight oil production was achieved through intensive development of several key oil plays most importantly the Bakken Shale (North Dakota/Montana), Eagle Ford Shale (Texas), Permian Basin (Texas/New Mexico), Niobrara Shale (Colorado/Wyoming) and Anadarko Basin (Oklahoma/Texas).</p<br><pThe top 3 producing regions for fracked oil are Permian Basin, Eagle Ford and Bakken.&nbsp; They are significantly more productive than Niobrara and Anadarko.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now the hot play with production rapidly increasing.</p<br><pWhen the price of oil went down in late 2014, the rate of drilling decreased which provides an argument for the production declines in Bakken and Eagle Ford after their peaks in late 2014/early 2015.&nbsp; The price decline was indeed a factor but in the Bakken region of North Dakota, there were 2,817 more producing well, as of Dec. 2017, then there were in Dec. 2014.&nbsp; Oil companies didn’t stop drilling and completing wells.</p<br><pIt’s easy to assume that the Bakken Shale has truly huge quantities of oil based upon the extensive area of the play (see Figure 4) and the production results within the sweet spot.</p<br><p<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470827 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image006.png" alt="" width="259" height="194"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 4</strong</p<br><pThe problem is that about 90% of Bakken oil production in North Dakota comes from 4 counties out of the 16 in the Bakken region of North Dakota.&nbsp; Those 4 counties are where the sweet spot is located.&nbsp; Drilling outside of the sweet spot results in significantly lower oil production.&nbsp; From my experience, a high percentage of the wells in the sweet spot have initial production values over 1,000 b/d whereas outside of the sweet spot, initial production values are often less than 100 b/d.</p<br><pFor the period 2008-2017, total Bakken Shale oil production in North Dakota was 2.32 billion barrels.&nbsp; Art Berman, a petroleum geologist with decades of experience in the U.S. oil and gas industry, has estimated the economically recoverable amount of oil from Bakken, including Montana, to be approximately 5 billion barrels.&nbsp; The amount of oil produced from the North Dakota Bakken play over the last 10 years is approaching half of 5 billion barrels.</p<br><p<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470828 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008.png" alt="" width="772" height="450" srcset="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008.png 772w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008-304x177.png 304w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image008-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 5</strong</p<br><pFor the period 2008-2017, total Eagle Ford Shale oil production was 1.94 billion barrels (See Figure 6).&nbsp;

In 2016, there were periods with no drilling rigs because the region had been drilled to the point of saturation.&nbsp; Since 2012, natural gas production from the Barnett Shale has declined by over 40% and will likely continue to decline. &nbsp;The sweet spots of Bakken and Eagle Ford have now been fairly extensively drilled which creates a problem for future production like the problem in the Barnett Shale.</p<br><pHere is what Wikipedia says about the Barnett Shale region:</p<br><blockquote<pAs of 2007, some experts suggested that the Barnett Shale might have the largest producible reserves of any onshore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale_gas" target="_blank"natural gas</a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_field" target="_blank"field</a in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"United States</a.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Shale#cite_note-impact-study-1" target="_blank"<sup[1]</sup</a The field is thought to have 2.5×10<sup12</sup&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (71&nbsp;km<sup3</sup) of recoverable natural gas, and 30×10<sup12</sup&nbsp;cu&nbsp;ft (850&nbsp;km<sup3</sup) of natural gas in place.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Shale#cite_note-impact-study-1" target="_blank"<sup[1]</sup</a</p</blockquote<br><pThe point here is that the Barnett Shale is not an insignificant source of natural gas for the U.S.&nbsp; With intense development of shale oil and natural gas plays, it typically takes less than 10 years from initial production to the time of peak production.</p<br><pArt Berman has expressed the opinion that it’s unlikely that there will be shale plays that aren’t presently producing oil and/or gas in the U.S. that will produce significant quantities of oil and gas in the future.</p<br><pIn the initial boom of fracked shale oil production, there was a lot of hype about the quantity of oil available through fracking.&nbsp; The mainstream media made it sound like the quantity was so huge that it would ensure that the U.S. would be awash in oil for many, many decades to come.</p<br><pThe media appear to be basing their pronouncements on projections from the EIA.&nbsp; Petroleum geologist David Hughes has produced multiple reports highlighting the flawed assumptions of the EIA, the most recent of which is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/" target="_blank"http://www.postcarbon.org/publications/shale-reality-check/</a</p<br><pHughes states that EIA projections are <strongextremely</strong optimistic.&nbsp; That is a polite way of saying they are delusional.&nbsp; It appears that the EIA is assuming that well productivity outside of the sweet spots will parallel well productivity within the sweet spots.&nbsp; Based upon results thus far, that will not remotely be the case.</p<br><pWhy does the EIA assume that light tight oil production will remain high for decades to come?&nbsp; It appears to me that their objective is to provide comforting projections that will make the American public feel good, to feel that their high consumption lifestyles can continue for as long as the EIA can see into the future.</p<br><pThe EIA has a history of providing unrealistic projections, which I highlighted in this paper from 2012:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/"https://www.resilience.org/stories/2012-02-17/how-reliable-are-us-department-energy-oil-production-forecasts/</a</p<br><pUnfortunately, the U.S. media never questions the projections of the EIA.</p<br><pWhat oil companies are doing in the shale plays is extracting the oil that exists as rapidly as humanly possible.&nbsp; The objective of oil executives is to make their millions or billions of dollars before they’re pushing up daisies.&nbsp; There isn’t a lot of thought about the long-term consequences.</p<br><pBased upon results from Barnett, Bakken, and Eagle Ford, economically recoverable oil and gas is far more limited than the EIA is portraying.&nbsp; The Permian Basin is now experiencing extremely intensive development which will lead to the peaking of production in the not-too-distant future.&nbsp; Fracking will be a relatively short-term phenomenon in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;As Art Berman says, “fracking is a retirement party for petroleum geologists”.</p<br><pThe current administration is doing everything possible to open all federal areas closed to oil development in the U.S.&nbsp; The reality is that most federal areas closed to oil development do not have the geology necessary to produce large quantities of oil.</p

Even if the USGS says there are 896 million barrels (mb) of oil, that doesn’t mean it’s economically extractable.&nbsp; Alaska is now producing about 25% of what it was producing at its peak in the late 1980s (~0.5 mb/d vs 2.1 mb/d) in spite of many new fields brought on-line and new areas opened for oil development.</p<br><pWith the passage of the recent federal tax bill, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has been opened for oil development (ANWR is east of the Prudhoe Bay region).&nbsp; It is probably the last significant area in the U.S. that is geologically favorable for oil left in the U.S.</p<br><pI heard a comment on the radio recently that ANWR contains 19 Gb (billion barrels) of oil.&nbsp; A common tactic of proponents of oil drilling is to greatly exaggerate how much oil is in a region to make it appear too appealing to pass up.&nbsp; In reality, the best that could be hoped for is maybe 3-4 Gb of <strongeconomically</strong extractable oil.&nbsp; There is a good possibility that there is considerably less than 3-4 Gb of economically recoverable oil in ANWR.</p<br><pAmericans appear to believe that they are entitled to cheap and abundant oil and that the cheap and abundant oil will last forever.&nbsp; Cheap and abundant oil will go on until it can’t go on.&nbsp; Even the largest oil fields ultimately decline.&nbsp; As an example, the largest oil complex in the western world is the Cantarell Complex in Mexico (Estimated Ultimate Recovery, EUR,~20 Gb).&nbsp; In 2004 Cantarell was producing 2.1 mb/d.&nbsp; It Is presently producing approximately 0.25 mb/d (~12% of maximum production) as it rapidly declines.</p<br><pThe Prudhoe Bay oil field (Alaska) is the largest field ever discovered in the U.S. (EUR ~12 Gb).&nbsp; In 1988 it was producing 1.6 mb/d.&nbsp; In 2017, Prudhoe Bay, along with its satellite fields, produced ~0.28 mb/d (17.5% of maximum production) as it continues to decline.&nbsp; The large fields in the North Sea such as Brent, Piper, Forties, Statfjord, Oseberg, Gullfaks and many more show the same tendency to decline.&nbsp; The largest fields in the Middle East like Ghawar (EUR ~120 Gb) and Burgan (EUR ~70 Gb) are showing signs of strain from decades of intensive pumping.</p<br><pAre there not moral issues when it comes to using finite natural resources?&nbsp; If there are, we should consider the morality of how we are rapidly consuming our finite oil resources.&nbsp; Future generations may look at our rampant use of oil much differently than we do.</p<br><div class="featured-image-credit"</div<br><div id="dpsp-content-bottom" class="dpsp-content-wrapper dpsp-shape-circle dpsp-size-medium dpsp-has-spacing dpsp-no-labels dpsp-show-on-mobile dpsp-button-style-3" style="min-height:40px;position:relative"<br>	<ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-3 dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style="padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none"<br><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style="float:left"<br>	<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.resilience.org%2Fstories%2F2018-03-12%2Fthe-world-oil-supply-is-infinite-i-know-that-because-i-believe-it%2F&amp;t=The%20World%20Oil%20Supply%20is%20Infinite%3A%20I%20Know%20That%20Because%20I%20Believe%20It" class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" target="_blank" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style="font-size:14px;padding:0rem;max-height:40px"	<span class="dpsp-network-icon "<br>		<span class="dpsp-network-icon-inner"<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 18 32"<path d="M17.12 0.224v4.704h-2.784q-1.536 0-2.080 0.64t-0.544 1.92v3.392h5.248l-0.704 5.28h-4.544v13.568h-5.472v-13.568h-4.544v-5.28h4.544v-3.904q0-3.328 1.856-5.152t4.96-1.824q2.624 0 4.064 0.224z"</path</svg</span<br>	</span<br>	</a</li<br><br><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-x" style="float:left"<br>	<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://x.com/intent/tweet?text=The%20World%20Oil%20Supply%20is%20Infinite%3A%20I%20Know%20That%20Because%20I%20Believe%20It&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.resilience.org%2Fstories%2F2018-03-12%2Fthe-world-oil-supply-is-infinite-i-know-that-because-i-believe-it%2F" class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-x dpsp-no-label" target="_blank" aria-label="Share on X" title="Share on X" style="font-size:14px;padding:0rem;max-height:40px"	<span class="dpsp-network-icon "<br>		<span class="dpsp-network-icon-inner"<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 30"<path d="M30.3 29.7L18.5 12.4l0 0L29.2 0h-3.6l-8.7 10.1L10 0H0.6l11.1 16.1l0 0L0 29.7h3.6l9.7-11.2L21 29.7H30.3z M8.6 2.7 L25.2 27h-2.8L5.7 2.7H8.6z"</path</svg</span<br>	</span<br>	</a</li<br><br><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-print" style="float:left"<br>	<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="#" class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-print dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" target="_blank" aria-label="Print this webpage" title="Print this webpage" style="font-size:14px;padding:0rem;max-height:40px"	<span class="dpsp-network-icon "<br>		<span class="dpsp-network-icon-inner"<svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 30 32"<path d="M27.712 9.152c1.28 0 2.4 1.12 2.4 2.496v11.712c0 1.344-1.12 2.464-2.4 2.464h-2.432l1.088 4.896h-22.112l0.864-4.896h-2.624c-1.44 0-2.496-1.12-2.496-2.464v-11.712c0-1.376 1.056-2.496 2.496-2.496h3.072v-3.744h1.088v-4.128h16.864v4.128h1.088v3.744h3.104zM7.776 2.784v9.344h14.624v-9.344h-14.624zM4.16 15.232c0.96 0 1.76-0.768 1.76-1.728 0-0.896-0.8-1.696-1.76-1.696-0.928 0-1.728 0.8-1.728 1.696 0 0.96 0.8 1.728 1.728 1.728zM6.176 29.248h18.144l-1.504-7.744h-15.488zM14.24 25.632h-4.448v-1.12h4.448v1.12zM20.576 25.632h-4.448v-1.12h4.448v1.12z"</path</svg</span<br>	</span<br>	</a</li<br></ul</div<br>		</div<br><br>			<div class="res-author-credit container-fluid" style="max-width: 640px;"	<br>		<div class="row"<br>							<div class="col-12"<br>								<h4 class="margin-b-0"<a style="color: inherit;

Cumulative world oil production at the end of 2017 was approximately 1.36 trillion barrels (1,360 billion barrels).&nbsp; Since WWII, approximately 95% of the cumulative total global oil production has been produced (See Figure 1 by Jean Laherrere-the top brown line represents global oil production).</p<br><p<img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3470823 aligncenter" src="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001.png" alt="" width="835" height="597" srcset="https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001.png 835w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001-280x200.png 280w, https://www.resilience.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image001-768x549.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 835px) 100vw, 835px"</p<br><p style="text-align: center;"<strongFigure 1</strong</p<br><pJean Laherrere, an international petroleum geologist with over 50 years of experience, had estimated ultimate recoverable oil, excluding extra heavy oil, at approximately 2.2 trillion barrels back in 2013.&nbsp; It’s a good bet that the ultimate recovery of <strongeconomically </strongrecoverable oil will be less than 3 trillion barrels.&nbsp; At the clip we’re burning oil, we could go through a significant percentage of the remaining economically recoverable oil in the next 20 years.</p<br><pUgo Bardi makes the case that the actual oil production curve will look more like Figure 2.</p
