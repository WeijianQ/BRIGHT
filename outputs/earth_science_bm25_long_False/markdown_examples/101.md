# Query `101`

## Original Question

*Quite simply what is the highest point above sea level that is right on the equator, I figured it would be a mountain in the Ecuadorian Andes but the Kenyan highlands look to be a likely candidate as well. I've tried to find it but I simply can't find a map that has the equator and the altitude in a highly accurate format and resolution anywhere.*

Despite high year-round sea level temperatures, some higher altitudes such as the Andes and Mount Kilimanjaro have glaciers.
