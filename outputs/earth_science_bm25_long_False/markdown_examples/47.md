## Original Question

*I am working on a data visualisation of airline flight paths and their probability of forming contrails.

Given weather data for a specific area (location, time, temperature, pressure and humidity) and aircraft data (location, time, altitude, speed and engine efficiency)

Is there an equation that will give me a rough estimate of the probability contrails will form at this point?*

Discuss.: 28 November 2011<br>Revised: 6 April 2012 – Accepted: 10 April 2012 – Published: 3 May 2012<br>Abstract. A new model to simulate and predict the properties of a large ensemble of contrails as a function of given air<br>traffic and meteorology is described. The model is designed<br>for approximate prediction of contrail cirrus cover and analysis of contrail climate impact, e.g. within aviation system<br>optimization processes. The model simulates the full contrail life-cycle. Contrail segments form between waypoints<br>of individual aircraft tracks in sufficiently cold and humid air<br>masses. The initial contrail properties depend on the aircraft.<br>The advection and evolution of the contrails is followed with<br>a Lagrangian Gaussian plume model. Mixing and bulk cloud<br>processes are treated quasi analytically or with an effective<br>numerical scheme. Contrails disappear when the bulk ice<br>content is sublimating or precipitating. The model has been<br>implemented in a “Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool” (CoCiP).<br>This paper describes the model assumptions, the equations<br>for individual contrails, and the analysis-method for contrailcirrus cover derived from the optical depth of the ensemble<br>of contrails and background cirrus. The model has been applied for a case study and compared to the results of other<br>models and in-situ contrail measurements. The simple model<br>reproduces a considerable part of observed contrail properties. Mid-aged contrails provide the largest contributions to<br>the product of optical depth and contrail width, important for<br>climate impact.<br>1 Introduction<br>Contrails are thin linear ice particle clouds which form in<br>the atmosphere behind cruising aircraft because of mixing<br>of the emitted water vapor with cold ambient air leading to<br>local liquid saturation, condensation of water on aerosols,<br>and subsequent freezing (Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953;<br>Schumann, 1996). In ice-supersatured air masses contrails<br>spread and grow by uptake of ambient water. The total ice<br>mass content may be several orders of magnitude larger<br>than the amount of water emitted from the aircraft (Knollenberg, 1972; Heymsfield et al., 1998; Atlas et al., 2006).<br>Contrails have often been observed to persist for many hours<br>and transform into contrail cirrus, with considerable cloud<br>cover and optical depth (Detwiler and Pratt, 1984; Schumann and Wendling, 1990; Bakan et al., 1994; Minnis et al.,<br>1998; Duda et al., 2001; Mannstein and Schumann, 2005;<br>Atlas et al., 2006; Vazquez-Navarro, 2009; Atlas and Wang,<br>2010). Persisting contrails are often associated with, or embedded in thin cirrus (Sassen, 1997; Immler et al., 2008). In<br>regions with high traffic density, high humidity, and thin cirrus, contrails may spread quickly over a large region. Such<br>so-called contrail outbreaks may cause a considerable fraction of the annual mean contrail cover (Duda et al., 2001;<br>Haywood et al., 2009). Presently, more than 80 000 commercial flights per day are performed globally and traffic is<br>increasing (Wilkerson et al., 2010). A large fraction of the<br>aircraft cruises at altitudes where contrails may form (Appleman, 1953; Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Sausen et al., 1998).<br>Contrails may provide surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry<br>(Meilinger et al., 2005; Voigt et al., 2010). Contrails are visible tracers of aircraft impact on the atmosphere. In spite of<br>still large uncertainties, the climate impact of contrails appears to be important (Fahey et al., 1999; IPCC, 2007; Lee<br>et al., 2010; Burkhardt and Karcher ¨ , 2011).<br>In order to assess the climate impact of individual aircraft<br>flights, e.g. as input for route optimization (Mannstein et al.,<br>2005), for aircraft optimization (Green, 2002; Koch et al.,<br>2009; Schwartz and Kroo, 2011), or for prediction of contrail cover in an area with intense air traffic day by day (Duda<br>et al., 2009), one needs a model which is able to compute<br>contrail properties for individual flights as well as for a large<br>fleet of aircraft regionally and globally with short computation times.<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>544 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>Contrail and cirrus formation is a nonlinear process depending strongly on ambient meteorology and plume processes (Scorer and Davenport, 1970; Lee et al., 2010). These<br>plume processes are inherently subgrid-scale in multidimensional global models (Schumann and Konopka, 1994; Cariolle et al., 2009; Burkhardt et al., 2010; Paoli et al., 2011).<br>Plume ice cloud models with different degree of complexity<br>for mixing and particle microphysics have been developed<br>(Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996, 2009a; Brown<br>et al., 1997; Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Meilinger<br>et al., 2005; Naiman et al., 2010), but none of them treats the<br>whole contrail life-cycle from contrail formation until dissipation.<br>The decision of whether a contrail forms or not along a<br>given flight is a relatively simple task because it can be explained thermodynamically once the meteorological and aircraft parameters are sufficiently known (Schumann, 1996;<br>Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007). Weather and flight track data have<br>been used to identify contrail forming flight tracks and follow their advection (Duda et al., 2004; Atlas et al., 2006;<br>Duda et al., 2009). From comparisons with satellite data at<br>computed contrail-positions, optical and sedimentation properties were successfully deduced (Duda et al., 2004). Contrail persistence analysis was compared with satellite-derived<br>contrail cover showing high sensitivity to ice supersaturation<br>and vertical wind input (Duda et al., 2009).<br>However, the formation of ice particles in the exhaust jet<br>at time scales of 0.1 s to 20 s (Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998; Paoli<br>and Garnier, 2005; Paoli et al., 2008), their spreading and<br>downwash (Scorer and Davenport, 1970) with the wake vortices forming behind aircraft at time scales of 1 min to 20 min<br>(Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001) and their transition into widespread cirrus clouds and final decay at timescales of less than<br>a hour to possibly days (Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a),<br>are difficult to compute in one model. Three-dimensional<br>(3d) large eddy simulation (LES) models resolve the fluid<br>dynamics of wake vortex formation and decay (Gerz and<br>Ehret, 1996; Lewellen and Lewellen, 1996; Holzapfel et al. ¨ ,<br>2010; Misaka et al., 2012) and the bulk microphysics of contrails (Gierens, 1996; Chlond, 1998; Lewellen and Lewellen,<br>2001; Unterstrasser and Solch ¨ , 2010; Naiman et al., 2011),<br>but require large computing times. Even two-dimensional<br>(2d) variants of such models, which allow for parameter<br>studies and several hours of contrail ages, are too expensive<br>to be applied for simulations of a large ensemble of contrails with realistic meteorological variability (Jensen et al.,<br>1998a; Gierens and Jensen, 1998; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010b). Hence, simpler models with parameterized physics<br>are required, providing proper results for the whole contrail<br>life-cycle and for the global aircraft fleet under realistic meteorological conditions, with far less computing time.<br>Such a model, the “Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool” (CoCiP), is described in this paper. The model principles and<br>its application for comparison with satellite data have been<br>presented briefly before (Schumann, 2009). Basic model features and comparisons to in-situ observations have been published in Voigt et al. (2010). The model has been applied<br>to estimate the global climate impact of contrail cirrus and<br>to demonstrate the potential of mitigation of contrail climate impact by route optimization (Schumann et al., 2011a).<br>This paper describes the details of the basic model concept,<br>presents global results for illustration, and compares results<br>for a few special cases with other models and observations.<br>2 Model<br>2.1 The Gaussian concentration profile<br>The spatial distribution of concentrations in a plume or contrail segment (without or with ice) at any time t has to<br>be know for computing plume properties depending on its<br>width, depth, cross-section area, and shear-induced inclination. For this purpose, the concentration field in the plume<br>is approximated as a Gaussian function of given width (or<br>breadth) B, depth D, and inclination using the analytical relationships derived by Konopka (1995). Here, we describe<br>the concentration profile. The computation of the plume parameters and their integration in time are explained in the<br>following sections.<br>The concentration c of a species per air mass in the plume<br>with local orthogonal coordinates (x, y,z) relative to the<br>plume axis (x = flight direction, y = cross-direction, z =<br>vertical) is approximated in the plane perpendicular to the<br>segment axis by a Gaussian function of the position vector<br>x = (y,z)T<br>,<br>c(x) =<br>C0<br>A<br>exp[−<br>1<br>2<br>x<br>T<br>σ<br>−1<br>. x] (1)<br>The effective cross section area A of the plume follows from<br>the integral over all y and z,<br>A ≡<br>Z Z exp[−<br>1<br>2<br>x<br>T<br>σ<br>−1<br>x]dx.

(8)<br>For optical depth computation, as we will see, we need the<br>effective vertical depth Deff = A/B which equals D π/4 initially but gets smaller when the cross-section deforms with<br>ambient shear.<br>This plume model has been used in the past to derive turbulent diffusivities from observed trace gas measurements<br>and large eddy simulations (Schumann et al., 1995; Durbeck ¨<br>and Gerz, 1995, 1996; Schlager et al., 1997), has been applied for air chemistry, sometimes as part of regional and<br>global models (Schumann and Konopka, 1994; Karol et al.,<br>1997; Kraabøl et al., 2000), and has been used as benchmark for tests of other models (Naiman et al., 2010; Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a). Compared to earlier plume<br>studies (Danilin et al., 1994; Karcher ¨ , 1995), this model accounts not only for turbulent diffusion but also shear. Its<br>main advantage compared to an elliptical model described by<br>Naiman et al. (2010) lies in the fact that the Konopka-model<br>gives the exact solution of the advection-diffusion equations<br>for constant shear and constant diffusivities.<br>The shape of aged contrails is sometimes not too far different from a Gaussian plume shape (Freudenthaler et al., 1995;<br>Fig. 2. CoCiP simulation framework. For a list of CoCiP modules,<br>see Table 1.<br>Paugam et al., 2010). However, the initial exhaust jet, wake<br>vortex and contrail (with primary and secondary parts) often<br>deviate considerably from this shape (Sussmann and Gierens,<br>1999; Gerz et al., 1998; Holzapfel et al. ¨ , 2010; Lewellen and<br>Lewellen, 2001). However, the Gaussian approximation allows for efficient simulation of global contrail cover.<br>2.2 Numerical weather prediction input<br>CoCiP simulates the contrails formed for given meteorology regionally or globally. Numerical weather prediction<br>(NWP) data are used to determine the ambient meteorological conditions by linear interpolation for given positions and<br>times (see Appendix A2). (For a list of abbreviations and<br>frequently used symbols, see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix.)<br>Sub-module INITMET, see Fig. 2, reads input of discrete<br>3d and time-dependent NWP fields for pressure p, geopotential altitude z, horizontal velocities u (eastward) and v (northward), pressure change rate ω = dp/dt, absolute temperature T , absolute humidity q, cirrus ice water mass fraction<br>IC, fractional cloud cover CC, and kinetic energy of subgridscale motions ESGS. For analysis of radiative forcing, we<br>also require input for the flux values of outgoing longwave<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 543–580, 2012<br>546 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>radiation (OLR), the reflected solar radiation (RSR), and the<br>solar direct radiation (SDR) at top of the atmosphere as a<br>function of x, y, and t from the NWP model. Finally, we<br>specify the solar constant S0(t) for the time of the year consistent with the NWP data.<br>For global studies, we use analysis data from the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Center for<br>Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; see http://<br>www.ecmwf.int/research/ifsdocs/). Since a few years, the<br>ECMWF model allows for supersaturation in clear air which<br>has been demonstrated useful for this purpose (Tompkins<br>et al., 2007; Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007; Haywood et al., 2009;<br>Lamquin et al., 2009, 2012). The model assumes that ice<br>forms in a fraction of a grid cell when the supersaturation reaches the limit for homogeneous ice nucleation (Koop<br>et al., 2000), typically of the order 150 %. In this study, the<br>grid-cell mean humidity is taken as representative in both the<br>cloudy and clear parts of the grid cell. For regional applications, we used NWP input from the COSMO-DE model of<br>the German Weather Service (Baldauf et al., 2011). Also the<br>meteorological fields from a global circulation climate model<br>can be used to drive CoCiP.<br>Presumably the most critical input from the NWP model<br>is the relative humidity RHi over ice, which is the dominant parameter for controlling the ice mass content in contrails (Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a). Contrails like cirrus, once formed, persist when the relative humidity is above<br>a critical value RHic. In principle, RHic = 1. However, supersaturated regions are shallow and narrow and, hence, may<br>not be resolved by the discrete humidity field on a finite<br>grid. Moreover, subgrid scale variability could cause local<br>supersaturation in a grid cell that is subsaturated on average<br>(Lamquin et al., 2009). Hence, the critical value RHic is usually taken different and below 100 % in NWP models. In the<br>ECMWF model, this value is<br>RHic = 0.8, (9)<br>in the mid-troposphere, 1.0 in the stratosphere and follows<br>a smooth transition with pressure altitude between these two<br>values in the upper 20 % of the troposphere. For simplicity<br>of further analysis, we divide the input value of q by RHic<br>initially. Care has to be taken when interpolating humidity<br>(see Sect. A2).<br>2.3 Flight track and aircraft definition<br>CoCiP simulates the contrails formed by cruising aircraft,<br>flight by flight. Flight routes are prescribed on input as<br>a sequence of waypoints versus flight time. For example,<br>waypoint data from commercial flights over North America<br>and Southern Canada are available in the internet (Garber<br>et al., 2005). We got such data for case studies for German<br>airspace from the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) for a few<br>days in October–November 2008, and for the European and<br>the North Atlantic air space from EUROCONTROL for some<br>days in August 2005. A global data set was setup by the<br>United States (US) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)<br>with support from Volpe National Transportation Systems<br>Center based on a cooperation by FAA, EUROCONTROL,<br>and ICAO for 2006 (Wilkerson et al., 2010). For other periods, we simulate waypoint tracks for global commercial<br>aviation using aircraft type, airport-connection, and schedule<br>information from the Official Airline Guide (OAG), a commercially available product.<br>From such data, for each flight, a sub-module READFP<br>reads the input to define the aircraft type and a list of NW <br>1 waypoints Wi = (xi, yi,zi,ti), i = 1,2,... ,NW , in space<br>and time, specifying longitude x, latitude y, altitude z, and<br>time t, from start to end of the given flight track. The waypoints usually list the flight level zi which is converted to<br>a static pressure p0,i according to the standard atmosphere<br>of aviation (ICAO, 1964), see Appendix A4. CoCiP loops<br>over the waypoints or over flight segments Si = (Wi,Wi+1),<br>i = 1,2,... ,NW − 1. For each waypoint, we set a flag to<br>identify if the waypoint is followed by a contrail segment<br>or a flight segment without contrail. This allows considering<br>tracks with several non-consecutive contrails.<br>Wake vortices, particle formation, and the initial contrail<br>dimensions depend obviously on aircraft and engine properties (Holzapfel and Gerz ¨ , 1999; Sussmann and Gierens,<br>2001; Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009;<br>Voigt et al., 2010; Naiman et al., 2011). This model accounts<br>for the aircraft wing span sa, aircraft mass Ma, true air speed<br>Va, fuel consumption per flight distance mF , soot number<br>emission index EIsoot, and the overall propulsion efficiency η.<br>This efficiency is needed for deciding on contrail formation<br>(Sect. 2.4) and defined as η = Fa/(mF Qfuel) as a function of<br>thrust of engines or drag of aircraft Fa, fuel flow per flight<br>distance mF , and fuel combustion heat Qfuel (Schumann,<br>1996). The soot emission index belongs to the critical model<br>parameters, listed in Table 2. Aircraft usually burn kerosene<br>with water vapor emission index EIH2O = 1.23 and combustion heat Qfuel = 43.2MJ kg−1<br>. Other fuels can be simulated<br>as well, e.g. EIH2O = 8.94 and Qfuel = 120MJ kg−1<br>for liquid hydrogen (Schumann, 1996).<br>Type dependent properties are set in module AINIT.<br>The aircraft and operations data are collected from several<br>sources, such as the BADA data set (EUROCONTROL,<br>2009) and soot emissions estimated within the AERO2K<br>project (Eyers et al., 2004).<br>2.4 Contrail formation conditions<br>Each flight segment between consecutive waypoints on<br>which contrails can form is treated as a contrail segment.<br>We use the well-known Schmidt-Appleman criterion (SAC)<br>(Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953; Schumann, 1996).

The saturation pressures over liquid and over ice water surfaces, pliq and pice,<br>are computed as in Sonntag (1994), see Appendix A3. An<br>often used approximation for TLM (liquid maximum) is<br>TLM = −46.46+9.43ln(G−0.053)+0.72[ln(G−0.053)]<br>2<br>,<br>(10)<br>with G in units of Pa K−1<br>and TLM in ◦C (Schumann,<br>1996), and with errors below 0.07 K for 0.24 Pa K−1 <<br>G <23 Pa K−1<br>.

All these values are available for analysis within CoCiP. For kerosene-driven aircraft, at p = (100–<br>500) hPa, G varies typically within (0.6–4) Pa K−1<br>. Larger<br>values occur for fuels with larger water mass contents.<br>So far, no such approximation was available for the threshold temperature TLC at 0 < U < 1. Since TLC has to be computed for each waypoint, we developed a new efficient approximation as presented in Appendix A5.<br>An alternative contrail threshold criterion avoiding iterative solutions for given TLM has been suggested by Ponater<br>et al. (2002). Instead of T < TLC, it requires that the ambient<br>relative humidity U stays above a critical value<br>ULC =<br>G (T − TLM) + pliq (TLM)<br>pliq<br>, (12)<br>or correspondingly RHiRHiLC. This more efficient variant<br>is used unless TLC is required for analysis.<br>An explicit criterion for persistency as a function of supersaturation is not necessary in CoCiP. In case of very low<br>temperatures, short-lived contrails may form from the emitted water vapor even in totally dry air. Contrails are sometimes observed in slightly subsaturated air masses (Schroder ¨<br>et al., 2000; Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007; Kramer et al. ¨ , 2009;<br>Voigt et al., 2010). At least at low temperatures, it may take<br>up to an hour until the ice formed initially from emitted water is sublimated, see Appendix A6. Contrails in subsaturated<br>air masses reach small cover and, hence, contribute little to<br>radiative forcing (Ponater et al., 1996). Nevertheless, such<br>contrails may be important when comparing contrail properties to observations (Voigt et al., 2011). Also, soot properties<br>may possibly get changed when processed in contrails (Lee<br>et al., 2010).<br>2.5 Wake vortex downwash<br>Since the global climate impact of contrails comes mainly<br>from contrails surviving far longer than the wake vortex<br>phase, we do not resolve the details of the jet and wake<br>dynamics in the first minutes. Instead, we use a parametric<br>model to estimate the initial depth D0, width B0, and maximum and mean downward displacements 1zw and 1z1 such<br>that the follow-on advection and dispersion is approximately<br>consistent with the results of the Gaussian model. After formation of the contrail in the jet of the aircraft engines at point<br>“0”, see Fig. 1, the sinking of the contrail with the wake<br>vortex behind the aircraft is estimated using a wake vortex<br>model. The subsequent computations then start from model<br>point “1” at the time and horizontal position of the contrail<br>forming aircraft but at lower altitude, see Fig. 1. The plume<br>model assumes that aircraft wake induced turbulence affecting the initial plume dimensions has ceased at this stage.<br>A wake vortex sub-model WINIT computes the maximum<br>downward displacement 1zw of the contrails at the end of<br>the wake vortex phase as a function of aircraft and atmospheric parameters using a parameterization derived from a<br>nondimensional fit to results of the Probabilistic Two-Phase<br>Aircraft Wake-Vortex Model (P2P) (Holzapfel ¨ , 2003).

Hence, 1zw is rarely observed in the atmosphere because this occurs up to 50 km<br>behind the aircraft and the measurable wake turbulence is<br>weak at this stage.

For<br>the same aircraft mass, the initial depth is largest for weak<br>stratification. The initial width is usually far smaller than the<br>depth.<br>2.6 Initial contrail ice crystal mass concentration<br>We simulate the contrail ice properties using two plume-bulk<br>ice quantities, the mass mixing ratio I of ice in the contrail,<br>and the total number concentration N of contrail ice particles<br>per contrail length. We prescribe N and not the volume specific ice number concentration n = N/A because N is conserved during plume mixing.<br>We assume that the plume vapor is at ice saturation within<br>the effective cross-section area A (Eq. 3) of the contrail<br>plume at all times. Besides for young contrails with low<br>ice mass and low particle concentrations, this assumption<br>is supported for contrails after the vortex formation even<br>for large ambient supersaturation by large eddy simulations<br>(Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010a; Paugam et al., 2010) and measurements (Heymsfield<br>et al., 1998). The temperature increase in the plume from<br>combustion heat and later by sublimation heat is small after a few seconds of contrail age, see Appendix A6. Hence,<br>the contrails are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with<br>ambient air in the wake phase after contrail formation. These<br>assumptions are essential for efficient simulation. As a consequence, the ice mass content I can be computed from pure<br>thermodynamics. Otherwise, we would have to solve also a<br>budget equation for heat, and the resolution of vertical oscillations in stratified air would require time steps smaller than<br>N<br>−1<br>BV.<br>The initial value I0 at stage “0” is computed in a module<br>ICEINI as the sum of the water mass emitted by the engines<br>from burning kerosene mass per flight distance plus the water<br>mass concentration available from humidity in the air mass<br>entrained into the young contrail:<br>I0 =<br>EIH2O mF<br>(π/4)ρD1B1<br>+ q0 − qs(p0, T0). (17)<br>The first term is the water mass emitted by the engines<br>from burning kerosene per flight distance. The last two terms<br>measure the amount of water vapor above ice saturation<br>available in the air mass entrained into the young contrail.<br>This amount is deposited on ice particles at ice saturation.<br>Here, q0 is the ambient humidity (mass ratio) and qs(p, T ) =<br>(R0/R1)pice(T )/p is the saturation humidity at point “0”. I0<br>is replaced by zero if becoming negative (in dry air), and this<br>ends the contrail life-cycle, for such cases.<br>During sinking of the contrail with the wake vortex, part<br>of the initial ice mass sublimates because of adiabatic warming (Holzapfel and Gerz ¨ , 1999; Sussmann and Gierens, 1999;<br>Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001). Hence, the ice water mass<br>fraction I1 in the contrail at stage “1” (at the end of the wake<br>vortex phase) is smaller:<br>I1 = I0 − 1Iad (18)<br>where<br>1Iad =<br>R0<br>R1<br>hpice(T0 + 1Tad)<br>p1<br>−<br>pice(T0)<br>p0<br>i<br>(19)<br>and<br>1Tad = T0(R0/cp)(p1 − p0)/p0, (20)<br>with gas constant R0 and specific heat capacity cp of air.<br>Again, the contrail life-cycle ends if the above expression<br>gives a negative result (in dry air). Without aircraft emissions, a plume starting at p0 = 250 hPa, T0 = 220 K, with<br>RHi = 1.5 has to descend 400 m according to these equations<br>to reach saturation (RHi=1), in agreement with earlier estimates (Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser et al.,<br>2008).<br>2.7 Initial contrail ice crystal number concentration<br>The initial number of ice particles is a result of liquid droplets<br>which form by nucleation on emitted and ambient aerosols<br>and which freeze shortly thereafter (Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996; Fahey et al., 1999). The local relative humidity at the place of<br>contrail formation in the exhaust plume exceeds liquid saturation, so that liquid droplets form at least on the larger soot<br>particles in the young contrail, which then freeze quickly because they are relatively large (compared to volatiles), and<br>form at low temperature and high relative humidity in the<br>contrail. This nucleation process depends on aerosol properties, mixing, and local temperature and humidity in the<br>plume. This process has been extensively studied with measurements and models (Busen and Schumann, 1995; Schumann et al., 1996; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996; Brown et al., 1997;<br>Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998;<br>Schumann et al., 2002; Paoli et al., 2008; Wong and MiakeLye, 2010). Ice particle formation is a self-limiting process in<br>which vapor depletion by the first ice particles limit further<br>nucleation (Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998). The<br>initial number of ice particles is essentially determined by the<br>number of soot particles emitted by the engines (Brown et al.,<br>1997; Karcher ¨ , 1998). In principle, also nucleation in volatile<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 543–580, 2012<br>550 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>materials, e.g. sulfuric acid and organic material, contributes<br>to ice formation, however, the contribution of volatiles is<br>small for typical soot emissions and moderately low temperatures (Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009). The few existing measurements of ice and soot particle concentrations in young<br>contrails are hardly accurate enough to test this assumption<br>(Schumann et al., 2002). However, analysis of experiments<br>for different fuel sulfur contents show that the number of ice<br>particles in young contrails increases by only about a factor 1.3 for an increase in fuel sulfur content from 6 µg g−1<br>to 2800 µg g−1<br>(Brown et al., 1997; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998;<br>Schumann et al., 2002). Volatile particles contribute a larger<br>share to ice nucleation for low soot particle emissions (below 1014 kg−1<br>) and low ambient temperatures (below 210 K)<br>(Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009).<br>Hence, the initial number N0 of ice particles per contrail length in the freshly formed contrail at stage “0” is assumed to be determined by soot, and prescribed (in a module<br>ICEINI) as a function of the soot emission index and the fuel<br>consumption rate per flight distance,<br>N0 = EIsootmF . (21)<br>Contributions of ice particles from other sources, such as nucleation in volatiles or aerodynamic contrails (Gierens et al.,<br>2009; Karcher et al. ¨ , 2009b), could be included when proper<br>parameterizations become available.<br>Only a fraction of the ice crystals survives the transition<br>between stages “0” and “1”. Ice particle loss by Brownianmotion-induced coagulation after the jet phase is small<br>(Gierens, 1996; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Paoli et al., 2008). However,<br>important loss is caused in the sinking vortex (Sussmann and<br>Gierens, 1999; Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser<br>et al., 2008). Any initial supersaturation gets reduced by deposition of humidity on ice particles quickly and before the<br>vortex has reached its lowest altitude. The sinking vortex<br>with adiabatic heating causes local subsaturation around the<br>ice particles. As a consequence, the ice particles sublimate<br>and some of them disappear (Unterstrasser and Solch ¨ , 2010).<br>Also turbulent detrainment from the sinking wake vortex in<br>dry air may contribute to particle losses. These losses depend on aircraft type, aircraft speed and mass, soot and heat<br>emissions, humidity, temperature, shear, stratification, ambient turbulence, and particle sizes (Huebsch and Lewellen,<br>2006; Unterstrasser et al., 2008; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010a,b; Naiman et al., 2011).<br>Hence, we prescribe a “survival factor” fsurv of ice particles remaining after the vortex phase:<br>N1 = fsurvN0. (22)<br>As a first approximation, we assume that the surviving particle fraction is in line with ice mass changes,<br>fsurv = I1/I0, 0 < fsurv < 1. (23)<br>Implicitly this is a function of ambient humidity and temperature.

The difference is partly caused<br>by the small sinking distance z1 of the bulk plume (in contrast<br>to maximum sinking), see Eq. (13). In principle, ice mass<br>and ice number evolve differently (Gierens and Bretl, 2009)<br>implying different survival factors. Therefore, we cannot exclude at this stage that smaller survival factors might give<br>better results. Anyway, the ratio I1/I0 is aircraft dependent.<br>The survival factor depends on the temperature and humidity<br>differences relative to the SAC threshold values, see Fig. 5,<br>because the plume starts sinking with initial ice mass depending on these differences.<br>2.8 Time integration and segment trajectories<br>After contrail initialization at stage “1” slightly below the<br>aircraft track, the contrail trajectories and properties are followed with the Gaussian plume model until a given time of<br>analysis or until final disappearance of the contrail at any<br>later stage “2” (Fig. 1). This evolution is computed by numerical integration of the Lagrangian contrail position and<br>properties in a sub-module INTCOCIP. The integration in<br>time t is performed over a sequence of time steps 1t. For<br>global simulations, we may use large time steps, of the order of 1 h, for computational efficiency. The ice mass and<br>particle concentrations have to stay non-negative.

However, for accuracy at<br>large time steps, and because of strong nonlinearities of other<br>plume parameters, we apply the Runge-Kutta scheme with a<br>few (2–6) iteration steps. Accuracy tests have shown that the<br>time step 1t does not need to be taken much smaller than the<br>time step of the available NWP results. This is very important<br>for the efficiency of the scheme.<br>The integration over one step is performed in a sub-module<br>RUNGE. Time derivatives of X are computed in module DTCONTR.

> How are contrails different from other clouds?<br>Contrails are "human-induced" clouds since they are formed by water vapor condensing and freezing on particles from airplane exhaust. Contrails are always made of ice particles, due to the very cold temperatures at high altitude. Other types of clouds can be formed by water vapor that condenses on particles which are present in the atmosphere due to many sources, such as from volcanoes or dust storms, not specifically from aircraft exhaust. Those clouds are sometimes made of water droplets, and sometimes ice crystals, depending on the temperature where they form.

A new model to simulate and predict the properties of a large ensemble of contrails as a function of given air<br>traffic and meteorology is described. The model is designed<br>for approximate prediction of contrail cirrus cover and analysis of contrail climate impact, e.g. within aviation system<br>optimization processes.

The initial contrail properties depend on the aircraft.<br>The advection and evolution of the contrails is followed with<br>a Lagrangian Gaussian plume model. Mixing and bulk cloud<br>processes are treated quasi analytically or with an effective<br>numerical scheme. Contrails disappear when the bulk ice<br>content is sublimating or precipitating. The model has been<br>implemented in a “Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool” (CoCiP).<br>This paper describes the model assumptions, the equations<br>for individual contrails, and the analysis-method for contrailcirrus cover derived from the optical depth of the ensemble<br>of contrails and background cirrus. The model has been applied for a case study and compared to the results of other<br>models and in-situ contrail measurements. The simple model<br>reproduces a considerable part of observed contrail properties. Mid-aged contrails provide the largest contributions to<br>the product of optical depth and contrail width, important for<br>climate impact.<br>1 Introduction<br>Contrails are thin linear ice particle clouds which form in<br>the atmosphere behind cruising aircraft because of mixing<br>of the emitted water vapor with cold ambient air leading to<br>local liquid saturation, condensation of water on aerosols,<br>and subsequent freezing (Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953;<br>Schumann, 1996). In ice-supersatured air masses contrails<br>spread and grow by uptake of ambient water. The total ice<br>mass content may be several orders of magnitude larger<br>than the amount of water emitted from the aircraft (Knollenberg, 1972; Heymsfield et al., 1998; Atlas et al., 2006).<br>Contrails have often been observed to persist for many hours<br>and transform into contrail cirrus, with considerable cloud<br>cover and optical depth (Detwiler and Pratt, 1984; Schumann and Wendling, 1990; Bakan et al., 1994; Minnis et al.,<br>1998; Duda et al., 2001; Mannstein and Schumann, 2005;<br>Atlas et al., 2006; Vazquez-Navarro, 2009; Atlas and Wang,<br>2010). Persisting contrails are often associated with, or embedded in thin cirrus (Sassen, 1997; Immler et al., 2008). In<br>regions with high traffic density, high humidity, and thin cirrus, contrails may spread quickly over a large region. Such<br>so-called contrail outbreaks may cause a considerable fraction of the annual mean contrail cover (Duda et al., 2001;<br>Haywood et al., 2009). Presently, more than 80 000 commercial flights per day are performed globally and traffic is<br>increasing (Wilkerson et al., 2010). A large fraction of the<br>aircraft cruises at altitudes where contrails may form (Appleman, 1953; Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Sausen et al., 1998).<br>Contrails may provide surfaces for heterogeneous chemistry<br>(Meilinger et al., 2005; Voigt et al., 2010). Contrails are visible tracers of aircraft impact on the atmosphere. In spite of<br>still large uncertainties, the climate impact of contrails appears to be important (Fahey et al., 1999; IPCC, 2007; Lee<br>et al., 2010; Burkhardt and Karcher ¨ , 2011).<br>In order to assess the climate impact of individual aircraft<br>flights, e.g. as input for route optimization (Mannstein et al.,<br>2005), for aircraft optimization (Green, 2002; Koch et al.,<br>2009; Schwartz and Kroo, 2011), or for prediction of contrail cover in an area with intense air traffic day by day (Duda<br>et al., 2009), one needs a model which is able to compute<br>contrail properties for individual flights as well as for a large<br>fleet of aircraft regionally and globally with short computation times.<br>Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.<br>544 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>Contrail and cirrus formation is a nonlinear process depending strongly on ambient meteorology and plume processes (Scorer and Davenport, 1970; Lee et al., 2010). These<br>plume processes are inherently subgrid-scale in multidimensional global models (Schumann and Konopka, 1994; Cariolle et al., 2009; Burkhardt et al., 2010; Paoli et al., 2011).<br>Plume ice cloud models with different degree of complexity<br>for mixing and particle microphysics have been developed<br>(Miake-Lye et al., 1993; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996, 2009a; Brown<br>et al., 1997; Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Meilinger<br>et al., 2005; Naiman et al., 2010), but none of them treats the<br>whole contrail life-cycle from contrail formation until dissipation.<br>The decision of whether a contrail forms or not along a<br>given flight is a relatively simple task because it can be explained thermodynamically once the meteorological and aircraft parameters are sufficiently known (Schumann, 1996;<br>Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007). Weather and flight track data have<br>been used to identify contrail forming flight tracks and follow their advection (Duda et al., 2004; Atlas et al., 2006;<br>Duda et al., 2009). From comparisons with satellite data at<br>computed contrail-positions, optical and sedimentation properties were successfully deduced (Duda et al., 2004). Contrail persistence analysis was compared with satellite-derived<br>contrail cover showing high sensitivity to ice supersaturation<br>and vertical wind input (Duda et al., 2009).<br>However, the formation of ice particles in the exhaust jet<br>at time scales of 0.1 s to 20 s (Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998; Paoli<br>and Garnier, 2005; Paoli et al., 2008), their spreading and<br>downwash (Scorer and Davenport, 1970) with the wake vortices forming behind aircraft at time scales of 1 min to 20 min<br>(Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001) and their transition into widespread cirrus clouds and final decay at timescales of less than<br>a hour to possibly days (Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a),<br>are difficult to compute in one model. Three-dimensional<br>(3d) large eddy simulation (LES) models resolve the fluid<br>dynamics of wake vortex formation and decay (Gerz and<br>Ehret, 1996; Lewellen and Lewellen, 1996; Holzapfel et al. ¨ ,<br>2010; Misaka et al., 2012) and the bulk microphysics of contrails (Gierens, 1996; Chlond, 1998; Lewellen and Lewellen,<br>2001; Unterstrasser and Solch ¨ , 2010; Naiman et al., 2011),<br>but require large computing times. Even two-dimensional<br>(2d) variants of such models, which allow for parameter<br>studies and several hours of contrail ages, are too expensive<br>to be applied for simulations of a large ensemble of contrails with realistic meteorological variability (Jensen et al.,<br>1998a; Gierens and Jensen, 1998; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010b). Hence, simpler models with parameterized physics<br>are required, providing proper results for the whole contrail<br>life-cycle and for the global aircraft fleet under realistic meteorological conditions, with far less computing time.<br>Such a model, the “Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool” (CoCiP), is described in this paper. The model principles and<br>its application for comparison with satellite data have been<br>presented briefly before (Schumann, 2009). Basic model features and comparisons to in-situ observations have been published in Voigt et al. (2010). The model has been applied<br>to estimate the global climate impact of contrail cirrus and<br>to demonstrate the potential of mitigation of contrail climate impact by route optimization (Schumann et al., 2011a).<br>This paper describes the details of the basic model concept,<br>presents global results for illustration, and compares results<br>for a few special cases with other models and observations.<br>2 Model<br>2.1 The Gaussian concentration profile<br>The spatial distribution of concentrations in a plume or contrail segment (without or with ice) at any time t has to<br>be know for computing plume properties depending on its<br>width, depth, cross-section area, and shear-induced inclination. For this purpose, the concentration field in the plume<br>is approximated as a Gaussian function of given width (or<br>breadth) B, depth D, and inclination using the analytical relationships derived by Konopka (1995). Here, we describe<br>the concentration profile. The computation of the plume parameters and their integration in time are explained in the<br>following sections.<br>The concentration c of a species per air mass in the plume<br>with local orthogonal coordinates (x, y,z) relative to the<br>plume axis (x = flight direction, y = cross-direction, z =<br>vertical) is approximated in the plane perpendicular to the<br>segment axis by a Gaussian function of the position vector<br>x = (y,z)T<br>,<br>c(x) =<br>C0<br>A<br>exp[−<br>1<br>2<br>x<br>T<br>σ<br>−1<br>. x] (1)<br>The effective cross section area A of the plume follows from<br>the integral over all y and z,<br>A ≡<br>Z Z exp[−<br>1<br>2<br>x<br>T<br>σ<br>−1<br>x]dx.

(8)<br>For optical depth computation, as we will see, we need the<br>effective vertical depth Deff = A/B which equals D π/4 initially but gets smaller when the cross-section deforms with<br>ambient shear.<br>This plume model has been used in the past to derive turbulent diffusivities from observed trace gas measurements<br>and large eddy simulations (Schumann et al., 1995; Durbeck ¨<br>and Gerz, 1995, 1996; Schlager et al., 1997), has been applied for air chemistry, sometimes as part of regional and<br>global models (Schumann and Konopka, 1994; Karol et al.,<br>1997; Kraabøl et al., 2000), and has been used as benchmark for tests of other models (Naiman et al., 2010; Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a). Compared to earlier plume<br>studies (Danilin et al., 1994; Karcher ¨ , 1995), this model accounts not only for turbulent diffusion but also shear. Its<br>main advantage compared to an elliptical model described by<br>Naiman et al. (2010) lies in the fact that the Konopka-model<br>gives the exact solution of the advection-diffusion equations<br>for constant shear and constant diffusivities.<br>The shape of aged contrails is sometimes not too far different from a Gaussian plume shape (Freudenthaler et al., 1995;<br>Fig. 2. CoCiP simulation framework. For a list of CoCiP modules,<br>see Table 1.<br>Paugam et al., 2010). However, the initial exhaust jet, wake<br>vortex and contrail (with primary and secondary parts) often<br>deviate considerably from this shape (Sussmann and Gierens,<br>1999; Gerz et al., 1998; Holzapfel et al. ¨ , 2010; Lewellen and<br>Lewellen, 2001). However, the Gaussian approximation allows for efficient simulation of global contrail cover.<br>2.2 Numerical weather prediction input<br>CoCiP simulates the contrails formed for given meteorology regionally or globally. Numerical weather prediction<br>(NWP) data are used to determine the ambient meteorological conditions by linear interpolation for given positions and<br>times (see Appendix A2). (For a list of abbreviations and<br>frequently used symbols, see Tables A1 and A2 in the Appendix.)<br>Sub-module INITMET, see Fig. 2, reads input of discrete<br>3d and time-dependent NWP fields for pressure p, geopotential altitude z, horizontal velocities u (eastward) and v (northward), pressure change rate ω = dp/dt, absolute temperature T , absolute humidity q, cirrus ice water mass fraction<br>IC, fractional cloud cover CC, and kinetic energy of subgridscale motions ESGS. For analysis of radiative forcing, we<br>also require input for the flux values of outgoing longwave<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 543–580, 2012<br>546 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>radiation (OLR), the reflected solar radiation (RSR), and the<br>solar direct radiation (SDR) at top of the atmosphere as a<br>function of x, y, and t from the NWP model. Finally, we<br>specify the solar constant S0(t) for the time of the year consistent with the NWP data.<br>For global studies, we use analysis data from the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Center for<br>Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; see http://<br>www.ecmwf.int/research/ifsdocs/). Since a few years, the<br>ECMWF model allows for supersaturation in clear air which<br>has been demonstrated useful for this purpose (Tompkins<br>et al., 2007; Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007; Haywood et al., 2009;<br>Lamquin et al., 2009, 2012). The model assumes that ice<br>forms in a fraction of a grid cell when the supersaturation reaches the limit for homogeneous ice nucleation (Koop<br>et al., 2000), typically of the order 150 %. In this study, the<br>grid-cell mean humidity is taken as representative in both the<br>cloudy and clear parts of the grid cell. For regional applications, we used NWP input from the COSMO-DE model of<br>the German Weather Service (Baldauf et al., 2011). Also the<br>meteorological fields from a global circulation climate model<br>can be used to drive CoCiP.<br>Presumably the most critical input from the NWP model<br>is the relative humidity RHi over ice, which is the dominant parameter for controlling the ice mass content in contrails (Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a). Contrails like cirrus, once formed, persist when the relative humidity is above<br>a critical value RHic. In principle, RHic = 1. However, supersaturated regions are shallow and narrow and, hence, may<br>not be resolved by the discrete humidity field on a finite<br>grid. Moreover, subgrid scale variability could cause local<br>supersaturation in a grid cell that is subsaturated on average<br>(Lamquin et al., 2009). Hence, the critical value RHic is usually taken different and below 100 % in NWP models. In the<br>ECMWF model, this value is<br>RHic = 0.8, (9)<br>in the mid-troposphere, 1.0 in the stratosphere and follows<br>a smooth transition with pressure altitude between these two<br>values in the upper 20 % of the troposphere. For simplicity<br>of further analysis, we divide the input value of q by RHic<br>initially. Care has to be taken when interpolating humidity<br>(see Sect. A2).<br>2.3 Flight track and aircraft definition<br>CoCiP simulates the contrails formed by cruising aircraft,<br>flight by flight. Flight routes are prescribed on input as<br>a sequence of waypoints versus flight time. For example,<br>waypoint data from commercial flights over North America<br>and Southern Canada are available in the internet (Garber<br>et al., 2005). We got such data for case studies for German<br>airspace from the Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS) for a few<br>days in October–November 2008, and for the European and<br>the North Atlantic air space from EUROCONTROL for some<br>days in August 2005. A global data set was setup by the<br>United States (US) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)<br>with support from Volpe National Transportation Systems<br>Center based on a cooperation by FAA, EUROCONTROL,<br>and ICAO for 2006 (Wilkerson et al., 2010). For other periods, we simulate waypoint tracks for global commercial<br>aviation using aircraft type, airport-connection, and schedule<br>information from the Official Airline Guide (OAG), a commercially available product.<br>From such data, for each flight, a sub-module READFP<br>reads the input to define the aircraft type and a list of NW <br>1 waypoints Wi = (xi, yi,zi,ti), i = 1,2,... ,NW , in space<br>and time, specifying longitude x, latitude y, altitude z, and<br>time t, from start to end of the given flight track. The waypoints usually list the flight level zi which is converted to<br>a static pressure p0,i according to the standard atmosphere<br>of aviation (ICAO, 1964), see Appendix A4. CoCiP loops<br>over the waypoints or over flight segments Si = (Wi,Wi+1),<br>i = 1,2,... ,NW − 1. For each waypoint, we set a flag to<br>identify if the waypoint is followed by a contrail segment<br>or a flight segment without contrail. This allows considering<br>tracks with several non-consecutive contrails.<br>Wake vortices, particle formation, and the initial contrail<br>dimensions depend obviously on aircraft and engine properties (Holzapfel and Gerz ¨ , 1999; Sussmann and Gierens,<br>2001; Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009;<br>Voigt et al., 2010; Naiman et al., 2011). This model accounts<br>for the aircraft wing span sa, aircraft mass Ma, true air speed<br>Va, fuel consumption per flight distance mF , soot number<br>emission index EIsoot, and the overall propulsion efficiency η.<br>This efficiency is needed for deciding on contrail formation<br>(Sect. 2.4) and defined as η = Fa/(mF Qfuel) as a function of<br>thrust of engines or drag of aircraft Fa, fuel flow per flight<br>distance mF , and fuel combustion heat Qfuel (Schumann,<br>1996). The soot emission index belongs to the critical model<br>parameters, listed in Table 2. Aircraft usually burn kerosene<br>with water vapor emission index EIH2O = 1.23 and combustion heat Qfuel = 43.2MJ kg−1<br>. Other fuels can be simulated<br>as well, e.g. EIH2O = 8.94 and Qfuel = 120MJ kg−1<br>for liquid hydrogen (Schumann, 1996).<br>Type dependent properties are set in module AINIT.<br>The aircraft and operations data are collected from several<br>sources, such as the BADA data set (EUROCONTROL,<br>2009) and soot emissions estimated within the AERO2K<br>project (Eyers et al., 2004).<br>2.4 Contrail formation conditions<br>Each flight segment between consecutive waypoints on<br>which contrails can form is treated as a contrail segment.<br>We use the well-known Schmidt-Appleman criterion (SAC)<br>(Schmidt, 1941; Appleman, 1953; Schumann, 1996).

All these values are available for analysis within CoCiP. For kerosene-driven aircraft, at p = (100–<br>500) hPa, G varies typically within (0.6–4) Pa K−1<br>. Larger<br>values occur for fuels with larger water mass contents.<br>So far, no such approximation was available for the threshold temperature TLC at 0 < U < 1. Since TLC has to be computed for each waypoint, we developed a new efficient approximation as presented in Appendix A5.<br>An alternative contrail threshold criterion avoiding iterative solutions for given TLM has been suggested by Ponater<br>et al. (2002). Instead of T < TLC, it requires that the ambient<br>relative humidity U stays above a critical value<br>ULC =<br>G (T − TLM) + pliq (TLM)<br>pliq<br>, (12)<br>or correspondingly RHiRHiLC. This more efficient variant<br>is used unless TLC is required for analysis.<br>An explicit criterion for persistency as a function of supersaturation is not necessary in CoCiP. In case of very low<br>temperatures, short-lived contrails may form from the emitted water vapor even in totally dry air. Contrails are sometimes observed in slightly subsaturated air masses (Schroder ¨<br>et al., 2000; Radel and Shine ¨ , 2007; Kramer et al. ¨ , 2009;<br>Voigt et al., 2010). At least at low temperatures, it may take<br>up to an hour until the ice formed initially from emitted water is sublimated, see Appendix A6. Contrails in subsaturated<br>air masses reach small cover and, hence, contribute little to<br>radiative forcing (Ponater et al., 1996). Nevertheless, such<br>contrails may be important when comparing contrail properties to observations (Voigt et al., 2011). Also, soot properties<br>may possibly get changed when processed in contrails (Lee<br>et al., 2010).<br>2.5 Wake vortex downwash<br>Since the global climate impact of contrails comes mainly<br>from contrails surviving far longer than the wake vortex<br>phase, we do not resolve the details of the jet and wake<br>dynamics in the first minutes. Instead, we use a parametric<br>model to estimate the initial depth D0, width B0, and maximum and mean downward displacements 1zw and 1z1 such<br>that the follow-on advection and dispersion is approximately<br>consistent with the results of the Gaussian model. After formation of the contrail in the jet of the aircraft engines at point<br>“0”, see Fig. 1, the sinking of the contrail with the wake<br>vortex behind the aircraft is estimated using a wake vortex<br>model. The subsequent computations then start from model<br>point “1” at the time and horizontal position of the contrail<br>forming aircraft but at lower altitude, see Fig. 1. The plume<br>model assumes that aircraft wake induced turbulence affecting the initial plume dimensions has ceased at this stage.<br>A wake vortex sub-model WINIT computes the maximum<br>downward displacement 1zw of the contrails at the end of<br>the wake vortex phase as a function of aircraft and atmospheric parameters using a parameterization derived from a<br>nondimensional fit to results of the Probabilistic Two-Phase<br>Aircraft Wake-Vortex Model (P2P) (Holzapfel ¨ , 2003).

Besides for young contrails with low<br>ice mass and low particle concentrations, this assumption<br>is supported for contrails after the vortex formation even<br>for large ambient supersaturation by large eddy simulations<br>(Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010a; Paugam et al., 2010) and measurements (Heymsfield<br>et al., 1998). The temperature increase in the plume from<br>combustion heat and later by sublimation heat is small after a few seconds of contrail age, see Appendix A6. Hence,<br>the contrails are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with<br>ambient air in the wake phase after contrail formation. These<br>assumptions are essential for efficient simulation. As a consequence, the ice mass content I can be computed from pure<br>thermodynamics. Otherwise, we would have to solve also a<br>budget equation for heat, and the resolution of vertical oscillations in stratified air would require time steps smaller than<br>N<br>−1<br>BV.<br>The initial value I0 at stage “0” is computed in a module<br>ICEINI as the sum of the water mass emitted by the engines<br>from burning kerosene mass per flight distance plus the water<br>mass concentration available from humidity in the air mass<br>entrained into the young contrail:<br>I0 =<br>EIH2O mF<br>(π/4)ρD1B1<br>+ q0 − qs(p0, T0). (17)<br>The first term is the water mass emitted by the engines<br>from burning kerosene per flight distance. The last two terms<br>measure the amount of water vapor above ice saturation<br>available in the air mass entrained into the young contrail.<br>This amount is deposited on ice particles at ice saturation.<br>Here, q0 is the ambient humidity (mass ratio) and qs(p, T ) =<br>(R0/R1)pice(T )/p is the saturation humidity at point “0”. I0<br>is replaced by zero if becoming negative (in dry air), and this<br>ends the contrail life-cycle, for such cases.<br>During sinking of the contrail with the wake vortex, part<br>of the initial ice mass sublimates because of adiabatic warming (Holzapfel and Gerz ¨ , 1999; Sussmann and Gierens, 1999;<br>Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001). Hence, the ice water mass<br>fraction I1 in the contrail at stage “1” (at the end of the wake<br>vortex phase) is smaller:<br>I1 = I0 − 1Iad (18)<br>where<br>1Iad =<br>R0<br>R1<br>hpice(T0 + 1Tad)<br>p1<br>−<br>pice(T0)<br>p0<br>i<br>(19)<br>and<br>1Tad = T0(R0/cp)(p1 − p0)/p0, (20)<br>with gas constant R0 and specific heat capacity cp of air.<br>Again, the contrail life-cycle ends if the above expression<br>gives a negative result (in dry air). Without aircraft emissions, a plume starting at p0 = 250 hPa, T0 = 220 K, with<br>RHi = 1.5 has to descend 400 m according to these equations<br>to reach saturation (RHi=1), in agreement with earlier estimates (Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser et al.,<br>2008).<br>2.7 Initial contrail ice crystal number concentration<br>The initial number of ice particles is a result of liquid droplets<br>which form by nucleation on emitted and ambient aerosols<br>and which freeze shortly thereafter (Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996; Fahey et al., 1999). The local relative humidity at the place of<br>contrail formation in the exhaust plume exceeds liquid saturation, so that liquid droplets form at least on the larger soot<br>particles in the young contrail, which then freeze quickly because they are relatively large (compared to volatiles), and<br>form at low temperature and high relative humidity in the<br>contrail. This nucleation process depends on aerosol properties, mixing, and local temperature and humidity in the<br>plume. This process has been extensively studied with measurements and models (Busen and Schumann, 1995; Schumann et al., 1996; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1996; Brown et al., 1997;<br>Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998;<br>Schumann et al., 2002; Paoli et al., 2008; Wong and MiakeLye, 2010). Ice particle formation is a self-limiting process in<br>which vapor depletion by the first ice particles limit further<br>nucleation (Jensen et al., 1998b; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998). The<br>initial number of ice particles is essentially determined by the<br>number of soot particles emitted by the engines (Brown et al.,<br>1997; Karcher ¨ , 1998). In principle, also nucleation in volatile<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 543–580, 2012<br>550 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>materials, e.g. sulfuric acid and organic material, contributes<br>to ice formation, however, the contribution of volatiles is<br>small for typical soot emissions and moderately low temperatures (Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009). The few existing measurements of ice and soot particle concentrations in young<br>contrails are hardly accurate enough to test this assumption<br>(Schumann et al., 2002). However, analysis of experiments<br>for different fuel sulfur contents show that the number of ice<br>particles in young contrails increases by only about a factor 1.3 for an increase in fuel sulfur content from 6 µg g−1<br>to 2800 µg g−1<br>(Brown et al., 1997; Karcher et al. ¨ , 1998;<br>Schumann et al., 2002). Volatile particles contribute a larger<br>share to ice nucleation for low soot particle emissions (below 1014 kg−1<br>) and low ambient temperatures (below 210 K)<br>(Karcher and Yu ¨ , 2009).<br>Hence, the initial number N0 of ice particles per contrail length in the freshly formed contrail at stage “0” is assumed to be determined by soot, and prescribed (in a module<br>ICEINI) as a function of the soot emission index and the fuel<br>consumption rate per flight distance,<br>N0 = EIsootmF . (21)<br>Contributions of ice particles from other sources, such as nucleation in volatiles or aerodynamic contrails (Gierens et al.,<br>2009; Karcher et al. ¨ , 2009b), could be included when proper<br>parameterizations become available.<br>Only a fraction of the ice crystals survives the transition<br>between stages “0” and “1”. Ice particle loss by Brownianmotion-induced coagulation after the jet phase is small<br>(Gierens, 1996; Karcher ¨ , 1998; Paoli et al., 2008). However,<br>important loss is caused in the sinking vortex (Sussmann and<br>Gierens, 1999; Lewellen and Lewellen, 2001; Unterstrasser<br>et al., 2008). Any initial supersaturation gets reduced by deposition of humidity on ice particles quickly and before the<br>vortex has reached its lowest altitude. The sinking vortex<br>with adiabatic heating causes local subsaturation around the<br>ice particles. As a consequence, the ice particles sublimate<br>and some of them disappear (Unterstrasser and Solch ¨ , 2010).<br>Also turbulent detrainment from the sinking wake vortex in<br>dry air may contribute to particle losses. These losses depend on aircraft type, aircraft speed and mass, soot and heat<br>emissions, humidity, temperature, shear, stratification, ambient turbulence, and particle sizes (Huebsch and Lewellen,<br>2006; Unterstrasser et al., 2008; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010a,b; Naiman et al., 2011).<br>Hence, we prescribe a “survival factor” fsurv of ice particles remaining after the vortex phase:<br>N1 = fsurvN0. (22)<br>As a first approximation, we assume that the surviving particle fraction is in line with ice mass changes,<br>fsurv = I1/I0, 0 < fsurv < 1. (23)<br>Implicitly this is a function of ambient humidity and temperature. The survival factor varies between 1 and about 0.7.<br>all<br>heavy<br>RHiLC<br>0 2 4 6 8 10 12<br>Survival factor<br>0.7<br>0.8<br>0.9<br>1.0<br>Fig. 5.

Each point corresponds to an aircraft with properties representing aircraft types in the traffic input (black) or with<br>properties of an heavy aircraft (red).<br>LES models compute smaller factors (Unterstrasser et al.,<br>2008; Karcher et al. ¨ , 2009a). The difference is partly caused<br>by the small sinking distance z1 of the bulk plume (in contrast<br>to maximum sinking), see Eq. (13). In principle, ice mass<br>and ice number evolve differently (Gierens and Bretl, 2009)<br>implying different survival factors. Therefore, we cannot exclude at this stage that smaller survival factors might give<br>better results. Anyway, the ratio I1/I0 is aircraft dependent.<br>The survival factor depends on the temperature and humidity<br>differences relative to the SAC threshold values, see Fig. 5,<br>because the plume starts sinking with initial ice mass depending on these differences.<br>2.8 Time integration and segment trajectories<br>After contrail initialization at stage “1” slightly below the<br>aircraft track, the contrail trajectories and properties are followed with the Gaussian plume model until a given time of<br>analysis or until final disappearance of the contrail at any<br>later stage “2” (Fig. 1). This evolution is computed by numerical integration of the Lagrangian contrail position and<br>properties in a sub-module INTCOCIP. The integration in<br>time t is performed over a sequence of time steps 1t. For<br>global simulations, we may use large time steps, of the order of 1 h, for computational efficiency. The ice mass and<br>particle concentrations have to stay non-negative. Hence, the<br>integration scheme has to be accurate, positive definite, and<br>unconditionally stable.<br>The state of the contrail is characterized by a state vector<br>X(t, i), i = 1,2,... ,NW , containing X = x, y,p, σ, I,N , including horizontal positions, static pressure, plume parameters, mass specific ice mass content, and total number of ice<br>Geosci.

All components of X depend on<br>position in space and time t. The integration is performed<br>for each contrail segment between two successive contrail<br>points.<br>For the trajectory part X = (x, y,p) of the state vector, we<br>could use the standard second-order two-step Runge-Kutta<br>scheme (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). Lagrangian models for trajectory calculation in meteorology often use a first<br>order or the two-step second order scheme, which is unconditionally stable for smooth wind fields, without iterations<br>(Danilin et al., 1994; Nair et al., 2003; Stohl et al., 1998,<br>2001; Wernli and Davies, 1997). However, for accuracy at<br>large time steps, and because of strong nonlinearities of other<br>plume parameters, we apply the Runge-Kutta scheme with a<br>few (2–6) iteration steps. Accuracy tests have shown that the<br>time step 1t does not need to be taken much smaller than the<br>time step of the available NWP results. This is very important<br>for the efficiency of the scheme.<br>The integration over one step is performed in a sub-module<br>RUNGE. Time derivatives of X are computed in module DTCONTR. For each time step, these routines internally assume<br>that the input was given for a time point “1” and the integration ends after one step at a time “2”, with 1t = t2 − t1.<br>The Runge-Kutta scheme starts with a predictor step:<br>X˜ = X(t) + 1t<br>∂<br>∂t<br>X(t), (24)<br>followed by one or several corrector steps,<br>X(t + 1t) = X(t) +<br>1t<br>2<br> ∂

(27)<br>Here, we assume that the contrail follows the mid point of<br>the bulk of the ice particles under sedimentation so that the<br>point “2” gets displaced downwards according to the terminal fall speed VT . Vertical advection may be computed following kinematic or diabatic trajectories (Danielsen, 1961).<br>The local heating rates required for the diabatic approach<br>are not generally available from NWP output (Fueglistaler<br>et al., 2009). Here, we use the kinematic variant for given<br>ω, although it may cause excessive vertical dispersion and<br>noise for large time steps due to waves and assimilation errors (Schoeberl et al., 1997; Ploeger et al., 2002). Adiabatic<br>advection for constant potential temperature was tested, but<br>showed only minor changes in contrail statistics compared to<br>the kinematic variant. The other components of X are integrated quasi analytically as described below.<br>For numerical integration, one has to keep the way-point<br>variables at the start of the time-step, at the intermediate level<br>denoted with tilde, and at the end of the time step. Thereafter,<br>older results may be forgotten, unless required for later analysis. For old contrail waypoints originating from the same<br>aircraft at times before t1, integration is performed with the<br>given time step. For new contrail waypoints getting initiated<br>within the time interval, a smaller time step is used to reach<br>t2. Polewards of | y | 80◦<br>, these calculations are performed<br>in Cartesian coordinates to avoid the pole singularity, see Appendix A7. This seems to be common practice in trajectory<br>models (Nair et al., 2003), but details have not been published. Moreover, care is needed to make sure that the coordinates stay consecutive when passing the date line (at ±180◦<br>)<br>for periodicity in longitude (see Appendix A8).<br>It should be noted that advection with horizontally diverging wind fields changes the segment length L between<br>waypoints. Individual waypoints may depart from each other<br>considerably over the time of integration, so that L changes<br>by factors of order 0.5–2. Because of continuity, horizontal divergence is connected with convergence in vertical<br>planes and this reduces the cross-section area. The change<br>in segment length L(t) is taken into account when integrating cross-sections and the particle concentration N per unit<br>contrail length in time. Segment length is computed efficiently as square root of the sum of squared geographical<br>coordinate differences (in meters), except in polar regions<br>where great circle equations are used (http://www.astro.uu.<br>nl/∼strous/AA/en/reken/grootcirkel.html).<br>For illustration, Fig. 6 shows contrails analyzed for global<br>traffic and for ECMWF NWP data for a time slice at an arbitrary analysis time 06:00 UTC 6 June 2006. This analysis<br>includes contrails with maximum age of < 36 h. The code<br>actually reads NWP data for a 5-days period, including the<br>period 36 h before the analysis time. The plot shows in red<br>the contrails existing at the analysis time. In addition, the<br>flight paths of aircraft cruising in cold and humid air causing<br>at least short contrails are plotted for the 3-h time interval before the analysis time. Most of the contrails at analysis time<br>originate from recent flights but some from flights that occurred more than one day (and up to 36 h) before. Young<br>contrails experience little advection, but older contrails get<br>advected partly over large distances as indicated by the separation between red and black lines. Contrails occur in clusters in regions with supersaturation. Many of these regions<br>also include natural cirrus. This coexistence of cirrus and<br>contrails will be taken into account when analyzing the radiative forcing and contrail cirrus cover. The results will be<br>discussed further below.<br>2.9 Evolution of Gaussian plume parameters<br>The initially symmetrical Gaussian contrail inclines and<br>grows in cross-section area A with time because of shear<br>(vertical gradient of the horizontal velocity normal to the<br>contrail axis), S = dVn/dz, of either sign, and horizontal<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci.

(31)<br>The equations assume that only the horizontal plume scales<br>change inversely to the segment length L(t), while the vertical stays constant. The vertical to horizontal divergence ratio<br>could be estimated from the NWP model, if necessary.<br>The contrail model starts from initial values σyy (t = t0) =<br>B<br>2<br>/8, σzz(t = t0) = D2<br>/8, σyz(t = t0) = 0, see Eqs. (14,<br>15). Thereafter, these equations are used with equal-weight<br>algebraic mean values of DH,DV,DS, and S at times t and<br>t + 1t to integrate over time to t + 1t. (The accuracy of the<br>method might be improved by weighting the contributions<br>differently.) Linear diffusivity changes with time could be<br>treated analytically (Konopka, 1995), but any parameterization of the diffusivities as a function of plume scales makes<br>the equations nonlinear. Hence, the solutions are no longer<br>exact and the accuracy becomes time-step dependent. However, the integration is unconditionally stable and guarantees<br>positive definite solutions of σ.<br>In the code we compute A from Eq.

It makes the elliptical<br>contrail cross-section wider but also thinner. But in combination with turbulent diffusion, mainly vertically, shear enhances mixing considerably. The vertical diffusivity is most<br>important for growth, since when DV = 0 (DS = 0 because<br>of Eq. 28), Eq. (32) reduces to A(t +1t) = 2π[2DHσzz1t +<br>σyyσzz − σ<br>2<br>yz]<br>1/2<br>regardless of the shear value. The value DS<br>looses importance for A(t) when shear increases (Durbeck ¨<br>and Gerz, 1996).

Shear production of turbulence is driven by total<br>shear ST , while plume distortion follows the vertical shear S<br>of the plume-normal velocity,<br>S<br>2<br>T = (dU/dz)2 + (dV /dz)2<br>, S = dVn/dz. (33)<br>The Brunt-Vaisaila frequency NBV measures stratification,<br>and the Richardson number Ri the ratio of both.<br>N<br>2<br>BV = (d2/dz)g/2, Ri = N<br>2<br>BV/S2<br>T<br>. (34)<br>Molecular diffusion is negligible at plume scales because<br>of large Reynolds numbers. The state of turbulence in this<br>region is highly anisotropic and often composed of largescale horizontal quasi 2d motions with little vertical motions. These motions are composed of wavy motions and<br>intermittent turbulent spots (Dewan, 1979; Dornbrack and ¨<br>Durbeck ¨ , 1998; Riley and Lindborg, 2008). The kinetic energy spectrum follows a −3-power law for the large scales<br>and a −5/3-power law for smaller scales, suggesting either 2d turbulence or 3d inertial range turbulence, but local<br>isotropy requires smaller scales (Nastrom and Gage, 1985;<br>Riley and Lindborg, 2008). Wavy motions advect and distort<br>the plumes without mixing. As mentioned before, the dissipation rate is often small (Schumann et al., 1995; Kantha<br>and Hocking, 2011; Gultepe and Starr, 1995; Clayson and<br>Kantha, 2008). Vertical motions in stratified air are limited<br>by kinetic energy convertible to potential energy (buoyancy<br>scale LB = w0<br>/NBV). Overturning turbulence occurs only<br>for scales below the Ozmidov scale LOz = <br>1/2N<br>−3/2<br>BV (Riley and Lindborg, 2008). Only dissipating turbulence causes<br>essential mixing between plume air and ambient air. The<br>horizontal scales B of aged contrails are often in the transition region between the 2d-turbulence controlled by shear<br>and stratification and even the smaller vertical scale D is often far too large for being within the isotropic inertial range<br>turbulence. Estimates of kinetic energy from subgrid scale<br>models require knowledge of the Richardson number and the<br>length scales of mixing and dissipation (Schumann, 1991),<br>see Appendix A9, which is uncertain for NWP grids with<br>grid scales far outside the inertial range. Turbulence experienced by cruising aircraft (including but not restricted to<br>clear air turbulence) can be estimated from coarse NWP<br>fields (Sharman et al., 2005; Frehlich and Sharman, 2010)<br>but the scaling of this turbulence (composed of waves and<br>turbulence) to plume scales has still to be investigated.<br>Since the plume trajectory meanders with ambient air motions at the scales of the contrail segments by advection in<br>a Lagrangian manner, internal mixing is limited to motions<br>at segment scales. The assumption of the same constant diffusivities for young and aged contrails would certainly not<br>be appropriate. Instead, the diffusivities depend on shear and<br>stratification at plume scales. The diffusivity model used<br>here is based on classical fluid dynamics arguments, such as<br>Prandtl’s mixing length for shear driven mixing and equilibrium between dissipation and energy production by shear and<br>(negative) buoyancy, due to vertical mixing in stably stratified fluids (Hunt et al., 1988; Schumann, 1991; Schumann<br>and Gerz, 1995).<br>Vertical diffusivities derived from measurements in the<br>free atmosphere are typically (0–1) m2<br>s<br>−1<br>(Pavelin et al.,<br>2002). Only slightly larger values occur locally in buoyant plumes (Pisso et al., 2009) or in breaking gravity<br>waves (Dornbrack and D ¨ urbeck ¨ , 1998). Smaller values, (0–<br>0.6) m2<br>s<br>−1<br>, should be effective at plume scales. The horizontal diffusivities within a Lagrangian plume are of order<br>(5–20) m2<br>s<br>−1<br>for young plumes but grow to the order of<br>104 m2<br>s<br>−1<br>for wider and thicker plumes (Schumann et al.,<br>1995; Durbeck and Gerz ¨ , 1996; Pisso et al., 2009). Large<br>eddy simulations are prone to numerical diffusion in particular in the presence of shear and stratification (Durbeck ¨<br>and Gerz, 1995, 1996). They compute mixing in an Eulerian frame and do not identify the Lagrangian and scaledependent mixing. Therefore, differences between analytical plume models and large eddy simulations (Naiman et al.,<br>2010; Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a) can hardly be used<br>to constrain the model parameters for diffusivities.<br>Vertical mixing can be parameterized either for given dissipation rate  or for given root-mean-square (rms) vertical turbulence fluctuations w<br>0<br>N<br>(Schumann and Gerz, 1995).<br>Here, we prescribe w<br>0<br>N = 0.1 m s−1<br>to compute<br>DV =<br>cV<br>NBV<br>w<br>02<br>N + fT VT Deff, cV = 0.2, fT = 0.1, (35)<br>DH = cH D<br>2<br>ST , DS = 0, cH = 0.1 (36)<br>(To avoid division by zero, we constrain NBV  0.001 s−1<br>.)<br>The value of w<br>0<br>N<br>is related to the dissipation rate by<br> = ASw<br>02<br>N S<br>2<br>, AS = 0.5 (37)<br>(Hunt et al., 1988; Schumann and Gerz, 1995).

These values are within the range of measured<br>data (Schumann et al., 1995).

The shear diffusivity increases A only if SDS < 0,<br>see Eqs. (32) and (31). This sign is imposed by shear driven<br>correlations between vertical and horizontal velocity fluctuations.<br>DS = −CDS(DV DH)<br>1/2<br>S/|S|. (38)<br>As noted before, the value of DS is unimportant for strong<br>shear. Therefore, in the absence of further information, we<br>set DS = 0.<br>The shear S is determined numerically from the wind field<br>provided by the NWP model. The vertical grid spacing 1z in<br>such models is usually far larger than the contrail depth D.<br>Hence, the magnitude of the shear at contrail scale may be<br>larger because of shear by subgrid velocity fluctuations. The<br>effective vertical resolution 1zeff in respect to shear is usually larger than the numerical resolution 1z. By comparisons<br>to radiosondes, Houchi et al. (2010) show that the effective<br>vertical resolution of the ECMWF model for shear is about<br>1zeff = 2000 m. We, therefore, use a shear value which is<br>enhanced by a factor<br>fS = (1 + (1zeff/D)n<br>)/2, n ≥ 0. (39)<br>This can be justified by considering the relationship between<br>the mean squared shear and the kinetic energy spectrum E(k)<br>of homogeneous turbulence versus wave number k (Lilly,<br>1967):<br>h(<br>∂u<br>∂z<br>)<br>2<br>i '<br>π/1z<br>Z<br>0<br>k<br>2E(k)dk.

(41)<br>For isotropic turbulence in Komogorov’s inertial subrange,<br>m = 5/3, and hence n = 2/3. For stably stratified flows, one<br>expects steeper spectra, e.g. m = 3, and hence n = 0. The<br>true value of n needs to be determined empirically (Adelfang,<br>1971; Riley and Lindborg, 2008). For this model, we assume<br>n = 1/2.<br>The upper panels of Fig. 7 illustrate the order of magnitude of the contrail mixing properties computed this way. The<br>vertical and horizontal diffusivities, DV and DH, are small<br>initially and grow with time when the contrails spread. DH<br>is about 10–100 times larger than DV. The details depend<br>on age, shear, and stratification and, for high supersaturation,<br>also on sedimentation. The diffusivity values for the early period, (0.01–0.5) m2<br>s<br>−1 vertically and (5–20) m2<br>s<br>−1 horizontally, are fully consistent with estimates derived from measurements and large eddy simulations (Durbeck and Gerz ¨ ,<br>1996; Schumann et al., 1995). Also the later values are consistent with observations (Pisso et al., 2009). The thickness<br>and width values, D and B, are of the right order of magnitude compared to ground-based lidar and satellite observations (Detwiler and Pratt, 1984; Freudenthaler et al., 1995;<br>Duda et al., 2004; Atlas et al., 2006; Immler et al., 2008;<br>Iwabuchi et al., 2012). More detailed comparisons have still<br>to be made.<br>2.11 Contrail ice mass integration in time<br>The ice content changes with time according to mixing of the<br>water mass mixing ratio in the plume with humidity from the<br>ambient air. To simulate this process, we consider the mass<br>budgets of contrail air mass M = ρAL and contrail water<br>mass MH2O = M (I +q) per contrail segment. The humidity<br>q inside the plume is assumed, as before, at ice-saturation,<br>q = qs<br>.<br>The air mass M(t+) at t+ ≡ t + 1t is<br>M(t+) = ρ(t+)A(t+)L(t+). (42)<br>Here, ρ(t+) is computed for given ambient pressure and temperature at t+, and the contrail cross-section A(t+) from<br>Eq. (3). The segment length L is computed for the waypoint<br>geometry.<br>The water mass MH2O in the segment is composed of contrail water in the ice phase and water in the vapor phase at<br>ice-saturation. The water mass budget changes by mixing<br>with humid ambient air. The ambient air contains water vapor at mass specific concentration qa, and it may be supersaturated or subsaturated. Hence, at the end of the time step, the<br>amount of water mass in the contrail is<br>M(t+)(I (t+)+qs(t+)) = M(t)(I (t)+qs(t))+ 1Mqa, (43)<br>with contrail mass change 1M = M(t+) − M(t), and ambient humidity qa = (qa(t+) + qa(t))/2 on average during the<br>time step. We do not include ice from ambient cirrus and ignore the latent heat release for phase changes, because the<br>resultant temperature changes are small, see Appendix A6.<br>As a consequence, we find<br>I (t+) = [M(t)(I (t)+qs(t))+1Mqa]/M(t+)−qs(t+).

In case of<br>mixing with subsaturated ambient air and for decreasing saturation vapor inside the plume, the contrail may dry out. In<br>this case, we set I (t+) = 0.<br>Here, we could distinguish contrails inside and outside the<br>cloud covered part of a NWP grid cell, as assumed in the<br>ECMWF model. Tompkins et al. (2007) assumed ice saturation inside the cloudy part of the cell, qa = qs<br>. Outside the<br>cloudy part, qa = (q − Cqs)/(1 − C), where C is the cloud<br>cover in the grid cell. However, assuming that contrails occur<br>uniformly inside the grid cell, with a share C inside clouds<br>and a share 1 − C outside clouds, implies that the ambient<br>humidity qa equals on average the grid mean value, qa = q.<br>Still, there could be differences in the contrail properties inside and outside of clouds because of nonlinearities. Full<br>treatment of such differences would require considering two<br>types of contrails, within and outside cloudy parts of a grid<br>cell. In view of many other uncertainties in NWP humidity<br>predictions, we ignore these differences in the present CoCiP<br>version.<br>For interpretation, we note that Eqs. (42, 44) are discrete<br>representations of<br>dI/dt = (dM/dt)(qa − qs − I )/M − dqs/dt. (45)<br>We see that this differential equation describes the uptake<br>of ice water mass from the ambient air in supersaturated air<br>masses and the loss of ice water in subsaturated air masses<br>according to the change in contrail mass M(t). The ice water<br>content of the contrail adapts to changes of saturation humidity inside the contrail with given plume mass. The contrail mass and the ice content grow mainly by mixing with<br>ambient air masses. If the ambient air is supersaturated, this<br>supersaturation of the air entrained into the plume is converted to ice. If the ambient air is subsaturated, ice particles in the plume sublimate keeping the mixed plume in ice<br>saturation until all ice is consumed. For qa = qs<br>, we have<br>dI/dt = −I (dM/dt)/M, i.e. the ice mass content gets distributed over a growing plume mass with decreasing concentration. Moreover, the ice water content of the contrail adapts<br>to changes of saturation humidity due to temperature or pressure changes inside the contrail with given plume mass. Finally, we note that I = const in this approximation for constant ambient conditions, as it should.<br>The lower-right panel of Fig. 7 shows that the ice water<br>content of the contrails, at a given time instant, varies little with their ages. In fact, the IWC is mainly a function<br>of ambient ice supersaturation and temperature.

Mixing of air between the contrail<br>plume and ambient air conserves N but reduces n by spreading the ice particles over an increasing plume cross-section.<br>Without microphysical loss processes (and without nucleation, without mixing with ambient cirrus, and for constant<br>segment length L), the total number N of ice particles remains conserved. (The change in segment length L(t) is<br>taken into account, see Eq. (56), later). As a consequence,<br>contrails would stay infinitely for constant ice supersaturation, although getting thinner with time.<br>The lifetime of contrail clusters should be similar to the<br>lifetime of ice supersaturated regions (ISSR) (Gierens et al.,<br>1999). However, there are important differences: The lifetime of contrails is shorter because flight routes only exceptionally start when the air mass becomes supersaturated first.<br>The lifetime of individual contrails may be shorter than the<br>lifetime of contrail clusters. Moreover, the phase speed of<br>contrails and ISSR regions is basically different. Contrails<br>get advected with the wind while ISSR regions may be stagnant (at mountains) or move slower (in the upward motion<br>branch of cyclones, i.e. in so-called conveyor belts).<br>The lifetime of ISSR has been estimated from observations to be of the order of hours (Immler et al., 2008). A<br>mean flight path length in ISSR of 150 km, with a standard<br>deviation of 250 km, was derived from humidity measurements onboard commercial aircraft (Gierens and Spichtinger,<br>2000); hence, there were many small ISSR regions. The<br>longest distance flown inside an ISSR extended over more<br>than 3700 km (Gierens and Spichtinger, 2000). The mean<br>values are consistent with observed contrail cluster diameters of a few 100 km (Mannstein et al., 1999). If age scales<br>with this length and with the mean wind speed (possibly of<br>order 20 m s−1<br>), a maximum ISSR age of about 1 d is to<br>be expected, but most have likely shorter lifetimes. In two<br>case-studies, at different scales, the lifetime derived from<br>ECMWF trajectories was 6 and 24 h (Spichtinger et al.,<br>2005b,a).

At this time t, the contrails have large<br>cross-sections A(t). It takes a further time of order τdil =<br>A/(dA/dt) to dilute the plume to subsaturation. For dilution following a power-law with time, A(t) = A0t<br>n<br>, and for<br>n ≈ 0.8 (Schumann et al., 1998), the mixing time τdil = t/n<br>is large and the total contrail age t + τdil could reach twice<br>the age of ISSR masses.<br>The lifetime of contrails is highly variable (Detwiler and<br>Pratt, 1984). Contrail ages up to 18 h and possibly more have<br>been observed (Bakan et al., 1994; Minnis et al., 1998; Haywood et al., 2009). These ages may be exceptions, not the<br>rule. Contrails were traced in time with data from geostationary (Duda et al., 2001, 2004; Vazquez-Navarro, 2009) and<br>polar orbiting satellites (Atlas et al., 2006). Contrails become<br>first visible in these data after a dwell time of about (0.5–1) h,<br>depending on satellite resolution (Atlas and Wang, 2010).<br>Contrail clusters were often followed for (2–5) h (Duda et al.,<br>2001, 2004). An automatic contrail-tracking algorithm identified many contrails in METEOSAT satellite scenes with<br>mean, med, max ages (without this dwell time) of 51 min,<br>20 min, 14 h, respectively (Vazquez-Navarro, 2009). Hence,<br>we expect median contrail lifetimes of order of a few hours,<br>definitely shorter than what is computed without losses.<br>Therefore, we add particle loss models to CoCiP. The<br>model contains three of them:<br>(dN/dt)loss = (dN/dt)turb + (dN/dt)agg + (dN/dt)meso.<br>(48)<br>Unfortunatley, we found very little theory in the literature which would allow to parameterize contrail or cirrus ice particle loss processes within the framework of a<br>bulk model. The models used are mainly based on dimensional analysis. The modeled loss processes are designed<br>to simulate (turb:) particle losses by plume-internal turbulence, (agg:) sedimentation-induced aggregation (Solch and ¨<br>Karcher ¨ , 2010), and (meso:) losses induced by turbulent<br>humidity fluctuations by mesoscale turbulence and gravity<br>waves (Karcher and Str ¨ om¨ , 2003) and possibly plume turbulence (Gierens and Bretl, 2009; Unterstrasser and Gierens,<br>2010a). Also radiative heating of the contrail plume and<br>of individual (large) ice particles may contribute to particle<br>losses (Gierens, 1994; Chlond, 1998; Jensen et al., 1998a;<br>Dobbie and Jonas, 2001; Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010b).<br>Efficient treatment of radiative heating is possible (similar to<br>radiative forcing, see Sect. 2.14), but not considered in this<br>paper (Schumann et al., 2010).<br>Mixing of contrails with dry ambient air masses was considered for ice mass in the Sect. 2.11. If the ice size distribution would be narrow and if the plume is well mixed, then it<br>seems conceivable that the number of ice particles stays constant until all ice mass is sublimated, when all particles disappear suddenly. However, this is not realistic (Gierens and<br>Bretl, 2009). While growth of particles would narrow the size<br>distribution, turbulent mixing of cloud air masses with particles of different sizes tends to broaden the size distribution.<br>Eventually, mixing causes some of the smaller particles to<br>sublimate. We roughly model this with the first loss term,<br>“turb”,<br>(dN/dt)turb = −ET<br> DH<br>max(B,D)2 +<br>DV<br>D2<br>eff<br><br>N (49)<br>with ET = 1 as an adjustable parameter. The maximum function avoids large losses for the initially narrow plume, when<br>B < D, because the initial losses are included in the survival<br>factor, Eq. (22). The scale Deff is used instead of D because<br>it enhances the loss for vertically thin contrails. Parameter<br>studies, with and without this and the other loss models, show<br>that the “turb” part contributes to losses relatively to all loss<br>terms most strongly at low ice supersaturation. Further improvements appear possible in future model versions (e.g. the<br>losses may be humidity dependent).<br>Sedimentation limits the lifetime of contrails for high<br>ambient supersaturation when the ice particles grow large<br>(Schumann, 1996; Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a). During<br>sedimentation, large falling particles may collide and aggregate with smaller ice particles so that the total number of ice<br>particles N decreases. In a size-resolved model, with ni representing the number density of ice particles in a size range<br>ri–ri+1, the aggregation process could be parameterized by<br>a rate equation (e.g. Pruppacher and Klett, 1997; Solch and ¨<br>Karcher ¨ , 2010)<br>(d nk/dt)agg =<br>1<br>2<br>X<br>i+j=k<br>Kij ni nj − nk<br>X∞<br>j=1<br>Kkj nj , (50)<br>with rate coefficients<br>Kij = EA π (ri + rj )<br>2<br>|Vi − Vj |, (51)<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci.

Since we have no<br>explicit information on the particle size spectrum, we assume<br>that the size spectrum in the contrails has a width of order r,<br>so that (ri + rj )<br>2 ≈ 4r<br>2<br>, and |Vi − Vj | ≈ VT (2r) ≈ 2VT (r).<br>Hence, an approximate aggregation rate as a function of<br>mean particle size r is<br>(dN/dt)agg = −EA 8π r2 VT N<br>2<br>/A, (52)<br>with an adjustable model parameter EA = 1. The terminal<br>fall velocity VT (r, T ,p) is computed as in Solch and K ¨ archer ¨<br>(2010). The aggregation efficiency EA may depend on temperature (Solch and K ¨ archer ¨ , 2010). However, the aggregation is unimportant anyway at low temperatures (Jensen<br>et al., 2011). We find important contributions by aggregation<br>only for temperatures larger about 220 K when the ice water<br>content gets large (see Fig. 8).<br>Finally, we roughly parameterize the effect of subgrid scale vertical velocity fluctuations w0<br>meso, e.g. from<br>mesoscale turbulence and gravity waves (Karcher and Str ¨ om¨ ,<br>2003). The velocity fluctuations induce temperature fluctuations depending on vertical stratification and mixing, T<br>0<br>meso ≈<br>w0<br>mesodT /dz. Particles are assumed to get lost when T<br>0<br>meso<br>becomes large. In place for a better scale still to be found,<br>we compare to the temperature change for doubling ice mass<br>(Pruppacher and Klett, 1997),<br>1Tc = (R1T<br>2<br>/Ls). (53)<br>Here, Ls ≈ 2.8 × 106<br>J kg−1<br>is the latent heat of sublimation and R1 = 461.5J(Kkg)−1<br>the gas constant for water vapor; typically, 1Tc ≈ 9 K. Note that w0<br>meso is different from<br>w<br>0<br>N<br>, because it includes wave motions. Moreover, w0<br>meso is a<br>mesoscale property related to a NWP grid scale ` and possibly plume segment length, but different from the plume<br>cross-section scales.

(62)<br>The coefficient Cr measures the ratio between volume mean<br>radius and the effective radius. Its value Cr = 0.9 ± 0.3 depends on the particle shape and size distribution of the ice<br>particles, which are variable, so that this value is uncertain<br>(Schumann et al., 2011b).<br>According to Appendix A11, the local value of τ (y) =<br>fτ (y) τ for given y, as needed for analysis of contrail cover<br>for given optical depth, is a factor<br>fτ (y) = (4/π )1/2<br>exp[−(1/2)y2<br>/σyy ] (63)<br>larger than the bulk value τ ; fτ (0) = 1.13.<br>The contrail simulation ends when τ gets small (< 10−4<br>),<br>or when the number concentration n of ice particles gets<br>small (< 1 L−1<br>), or when the contrail center of gravity falls<br>below the lower boundary of the computational domain (typically at 600 hPa).<br>Figure 10 shows that the model computes optical depth<br>values within the range 0.001–0.5 in most cases, with larger<br>values for young contrails. This is fully consistent with observations and other models (Karcher et al. ¨ , 2009a; Atlas and<br>Wang, 2010; Voigt et al., 2011). However, with respect to<br>climate impact, it is the product of τ with the contrail width<br>B which counts. This value generally increases and takes a<br>maximum after about a few hours in this model, consistent<br>with observations (Atlas and Wang, 2010). Only a few of the<br>older contrails reach larger values. It implies that the largest<br>climate impact comes from contrails a few hours of age.<br>2.14 Radiative forcing<br>Contrails induce a change in net radiances at top of the atmosphere, which is known as radiative forcing (RF). RF is<br>commonly used for assessing the climate impact of contrails<br>(IPCC, 2007). For CoCiP it is essential to have a parameterization which allows for efficient computation of RF for<br>each contrail segment. The standard approach using complex radiation transfer models would be far too time consuming. Therefore, a new parameterization has been developed<br>(Schumann et al., 2009, 2012) which is briefly summarized<br>here.<br>The RF by contrails is computed separately for the longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) spectral ranges. For each<br>range, the local RF is computed as a function of the optical<br>depth τ , effective radius reff, and temperature T of the contrail, and optical depth τc of cirrus above the contrail. The parameterization uses NWP input for outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), reflected solar radiation (RSR), and solar direct<br>radiation (SDR) (Blanco-Muriel et al., 2001) for the given<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci. Model Dev., 5, 543–580, 2012<br>560 U. Schumann: Contrail cirrus model<br>atmosphere without contrails. Further input includes the solar constant S0 which varies with the day of the year a few<br>percent around the annual mean value of about 1365 W m−2<br>(Blanco-Muriel et al., 2001; Paltridge and Platt, 1976).<br>From these input values, the model (in module RADI)<br>computes the LW and SW RF per contrail area using given<br>analytical functions,<br>RFLW = RFLW(OLR, T , τ, reff, τc) ≥ 0, (64)<br>RFSW = RFSW(S0,Aeff,µ, τ, reff, τc) ≤ 0, (65)<br>with effective albedo Aeff = RSR/SDR, and cosine of solar zenith angle µ = cos(θ ) = SDR/S0. RFLW is constrained<br>to positive values, so that contrails at low altitudes with<br>high ambient temperatures have zero contribution. Likewise,<br>RFSW, is constrained to negative values. The model prescribes the contrail habit mixture as a function of radius r<br>(Schumann et al., 2011b). The parameterization with 5 fit<br>parameters for LW and 10 for SW has been calibrated for an<br>extensive set of atmospheres/surfaces against libRadtran forward calculations (Mayer and Kylling, 2005). The approximate results and the libRadtran results correlate better than<br>98 %. The RF parameterization is consistent with previous<br>results (Meerkotter et al. ¨ , 1999; Schumann et al., 2012). Preliminary RF results have been presented in Schumann et al.<br>(2011a).<br>2.15 Contrail cirrus cover<br>The ensemble of contrails together with the natural (nonaviation) NWP-cirrus is considered as the “total cirrus” in<br>this model. The additional cirrus induced by contrails is interpreted as “contrail cirrus”. Contrail cirrus differs from young<br>isolated contrails in shape. Single contrails widen by turbulent diffusion and shear, get distorted by variable winds, and<br>disrupted by contrail free segments, but still remain identifiable as a near-linear sequence of contrail segments in clear<br>air. Single contrails change their shape when overlapping<br>with natural cirrus. A cluster of contrails with different histories overlap irregularly so that the linear structure gets lost.<br>CoCiP in this version does not account for physical interactions between contrails among each other nor with cirrus.<br>However, CoCiP does simulate irregularly structured contrail<br>cirrus.<br>We define the regional cover C of a cirrus as that fractional horizontal area in which the optical depth τ of the cirrus is larger than a critical value τc. This seems plausible,<br>because only cirrus with a minimum optical depth is visible. Moreover, the optical depth controls its radiative forcing<br>and, hence, its climate impact. Details of detectability depend on underground properties, ambient atmosphere, illumination, etc. The threshold is observer and instrument dependent. Hence, cloud cover may be ill-defined. Here, we<br>orient ourselves on satellite observations, where a value of<br>τc ≈ 0.1 may be realistic.<br>Overlapping contrails are treated according to their known<br>position and optical depth. The coverage of overlapping contrails is far smaller than the summed coverage of individual contrails. In regions with many overlapping contrails, the<br>contrail cirrus cover increases less than linear with air traffic and saturates at a maximum value (which may be 100 %).<br>The cover gets even smaller when contrails overlap with natural cirrus. Hence, it is important to have a clear definition<br>of cover C. Here, we define the cover of contrail-cirrus (CO)<br>as the cover of total cirrus (COCI) minus the cover of natural<br>cirrus (CI),<br>CCO = CCOCI − CCI, (66)<br>based on their optical depth values, respectively, above a critical value,<br>τCOCI  τc and τCI  τc. (67)<br>More complex criteria, e.g. the contrast in brightness temperature and reflectance of contrails and cirrus, computed similar to RF, Sect. 2.14, might be included in future versions.<br>Here, the cover is computed pixel-wise based on optical<br>depth. The NWP grid is far too coarse to resolve the contributions from the relatively narrow contrails. Instead, we use a<br>fine-resolution matrix of optical depth values (“cloud mask”)<br>τi,j in grid cells (pixels) with far higher resolution and independent of the NWP grid. For global analysis, the grid center<br>points are located at xi = i 1x, yj = j1y, i = 0,1,...,NxT ,<br>j = 0,1,...,NyT , with grid spacing 1x = 360/(NxT − 1),<br>1y = 180/(NyT − 1). We use NxT = 5001, NyT = 3601 in<br>our global reference cases. The pixel area size is 1x×1y. In<br>this implementation its value is 5.7×5.6 km2<br>at 45◦<br>latitude.<br>Even this fine grid cannot resolve the very narrow young contrails, but these contribute little to the total cover. The resolution error caused by finite grid spacings depends on the ratio<br>of contrail width relative to grid resolution and on the threshold ratio τc/τ . It decreases with increasing contrail width<br>and decreasing threshold. The error gets small in particular<br>for many randomly distributed and overlapping contrails. For<br>example, for a region over the North Atlantic, for τc = 0.1,<br>mean width B = 7 km, and mean optical depth τ = 0.12, the<br>contrail cover changes by 5 % if the grid scale is reduced by<br>a factor 10. This appears to be acceptable.<br>The contrail contributions to τi,j are computed within a<br>module TAU2DS within the loop over all flights. The NWPcirrus contributions are added in module TAU2DX at the end.<br>As explained in Appendix A12 and Fig. A7, a segment contributes to τi,j when the normal from xi, yj onto the segment<br>(Wn,Wn+1) crosses the segment at a cross-point xs, ys between its endpoints. The amount τ fτ (s), see Eq. (63), of<br>contribution depends on the distance s between xs, ys and<br>xi, yj . In order to add all τ -contributions from all contrail<br>segments, one has to test the distance to all points (i, j ) in<br>the cloud mask. This time-consuming test can be reduced to<br>Geosci.

Schumann: Contrail cirrus model 561<br>pixels in a certain distance from the segment end-points, depending on the maximum product Bτ of the contrail segments. By this strategy, the computing time increases about<br>linearly with the total number of contrail segments from all<br>flights.<br>For analysis of contributions of natural cirrus to τi,j<br>in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (between<br>zmin = 6.0 km and zmax = 16.1 km), we first compute the optical depth τC =<br>R zmax<br>zmin<br>βCdz of this cirrus for given cirrusextinction βC = 3QCextIWCC/(4ρicereffC<br>), and extinction<br>efficiency QCext = 2. The effective radius is determined from<br>the NWP data as a function of temperature and ice water content IWCC of the NWP-cirrus. When using ECMWF data, we<br>compute reffC<br>consistently (Sun, 2001; Sun and Rikus, 1999).<br>Moreover, we account for the 3d distribution of cirrus<br>cover CC(x, y,z,t) inside a cirrus, which is provided as input for each NWP grid cell: For given CC(x, y,z,t), we<br>first compute a 2d cirrus cover effective for observers from<br>above, CiC(x, y,t) = maxz[CC(x, y,z,t)]. Since the cloud<br>mask has a far higher resolution than the NWP-grid, we distribute the broken cirrus coverage in the cloud mask randomly. For this purpose, we distribute the cirrus optical depth<br>τC in at least partially covered grid cells onto pixels, keeping<br>its grid mean value constant at τC. For each grid cell i, j with<br>CiC  0, a random number R, uniformly distributed within<br>0–1, decides, if R  1 − CiC then τc = τC/CiC, else τc = 0.<br>The value τc is added to τi,j as cirrus contribution. The randomly distributed cloud cover is evident in Figs. 11–12.<br>For example, the top panel of Fig. 11 shows the optical<br>depth of contrails (τCO) for all the contrails identified by<br>red lines in Fig. 6, while the lower panel shows the optical depth of contrails and cirrus together (τCOCI). Figure 11<br>(upper panel) exhibits again clusters of contrails over North<br>America, the North Atlantic and mid Europe. Some contrails<br>plotted in Fig. 6 (e.g. near 90◦<br>latitude in the Southern Indian Ocean) are invisible in Fig. 11, because of low optical<br>depth. When plotted together with the optical depth of natural cirrus (lower panel, only few contrails (e.g. over North<br>America) remain visible. This plot shows the optical depth of<br>ice clouds above 6 km altitude. This includes deep convective clouds with quite large optical depth, in particular in the<br>tropics.<br>Figure 12 shows the computed cover for a contrail outbreak over parts of North America. The upper part shows the<br>cover CCO of contrails (τCO  0.1) alone, while the lower<br>panel shows the cover of total cirrus CCOCI as composed<br>of natural cirrus (τCI  0.1, blue pixels) and contrail-cirrus<br>(τCI < 0.1 and τCOCI  0.1, red pixels). Contrails inside (or<br>above/below) thick cirrus do not contribute to contrail-cirrus<br>cover. In fact, a large fraction of contrail pixels (about 2/3<br>globally) become invisible inside natural cirrus. However,<br>even thin contrails may push the optical depth of thin cirrus above the critical value. The contrail outbreak happens to<br>occur in this simulation over North America (at 10 pm local<br>time). Some contrails are still identifiable as linear structures.<br>However, the linear shape gets lost in contrail clusters, which<br>mostly occur in the neighborhood of natural cirrus. Still part<br>of the contrail pixels remain visible in the total cirrus results while others submerge in natural cirrus. Some of the<br>additional contrail cirrus pixels are closing cloud gaps in the<br>natural cirrus cover. Regionally, over (100–600) km scales in<br>this example, the contrails cause 100 % cirrus cover.<br>For this cloud mask, we finally compute global or regional cloud covers by summing the areas of pixel cells<br>with CCOCI = 1 and CCI = 0, and dividing by the respective<br>global or regional total horizontal area. The results depend<br>nonlinearly on the threshold value τc. For τc = 0.1 and 0.05,<br>in this example, for a single time slice, the global contrail<br>coverage is 0.23 % and 0.36 % (NWP cirrus cover: 19 % and<br>27 %), respectively. Hence, the value of τc has to be carefully<br>selected for meaningful comparisons to observations.<br>3 Results and discussions<br>3.1 Example simulation of contrails<br>As discussed before, see Figs. 6, 11, and 12, CoCiP has<br>been applied for a global case study using NWP data from<br>ECMWF and traffic data from FAA-EUROCONTROL. The<br>global simulation identifies 31 575 flights in the time period<br>03:00–06:00 UTC 6 June 2006, forming at least short contrails. In this simulation, the time step is 1t = 1 h. The computation time is 3.5 min (including a large fraction for I/O<br>time). Hence, for each contrail, less than 0.01 s is needed.<br>For a snapshot at 06:00 UTC that day, a total of 3402 contrails are found. This clearly demonstrates the size of the<br>problem and the efficiency of the method. Still, to simulate<br>a full year hourly with an order 30 million flights globally,<br>requires about 7 h of computing time.<br>Figures 7–10 show the contrail properties for a random<br>subset of contrail segments over the North Atlantic. As<br>discussed above, the resultant contrail dimensions and ice<br>properties exhibit magnitudes and trends with age at least<br>roughly consistent with observations. The simulations were<br>performed with model parameters as explained. The most<br>important parameters and their values are set as listed in<br>Table 2. For quantitative assessment, we next consider case<br>studies for single contrails.<br>3.2 Dilution<br>The dilution ratio of passive tracers emitted form aircraft<br>was discussed before. It determines the mass specific concentration above background for given emission index EI as<br>1c = EI/Ndil. The empirical function, Eq. (16), was derived<br>from measurements for plume ages t up to 5000 s, with about<br>factor three uncertainty (Schumann et al., 1998).

As to be expected, the dilution is stronger for smaller<br>aircraft, stronger shear, and weaker stratification. Overall,<br>the order of magnitude agrees with Eq. (16). In fact, CoCiP<br>provides a generalization of this function for given parameters. This agreement is sensitive to various model parameters<br>Table 2.

In addition, we vary DV (reference as in Eq. 35), to explain differences between CoCiP<br>and the 2d model, see Figs. 14 and 15.<br>CoCiP is run in this case with time steps of 150 s (5 s in the<br>2d model). Small wiggles in the CoCiP τ values are caused<br>by Mie oscillations, Eq. (61). Wiggles at late times are caused<br>by accumulation of approximation errors in the late exponential particle growth phase. Note that the model contains<br>no smoothing which could damp oscillations along waypoint<br>tracks. These wiggles are avoided when using smaller time<br>steps.<br>Qualitatively, the results of the two models are similar in<br>magnitude and trends, but significant differences are notable.<br>The CoCiP contrail width (Fig. 14 left upper panel) initially<br>increases linearly with time because shear dominates the lateral spread at early times. Note that the width B as defined<br>by the Gaussian plume model is plotted. Smaller plume concentrations spread further away from the contrail center line.<br>In the 2d model, the width of the contrail is defined as that<br>part with optical depth larger than given threshold values,<br>as identified in the figure legend (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1).<br>Our reference case agrees best with the 2d results for optical depth 0.01–0.05. In principle, a similar threshold-width<br>could be computed for the Gaussian profiles in CoCiP. But<br>more important is the product of optical depth with contrail<br>width (or its integral over the lateral coordinate), see Eq. (58),<br>which controls cover and radiative forcing. The right panels<br>of Fig. 14 show τ and this integral value or product τB. We<br>see that the two models agree for these important parameters<br>to the order of magnitude. Best agreement is achieved at early<br>times for enhanced vertical diffusivity. Later, the width grows<br>stronger than linear in CoCiP because of increasing depth<br>making shear dispersion more efficient. The thicker depth at<br>later times is mainly caused by sedimentation. For reduced<br>particle emissions, sedimentation becomes important earlier,<br>as expected, so that the width grows more quickly. The thickness also increases for enhanced vertical diffusivity.<br>The dilution at one hour of age (not shown) is about a factor 4 larger for enhanced vertical diffusivity. Sedimentation<br>effects on dilution are still small (10 %–20 %) at this age. For<br>lower diffusivity, the dilution is slightly (30 %) below, for<br>higher diffusivity, it is 3 times above the empirical function<br>Eq. (16).

Therefore, in spite of the<br>size of the aircraft, CoCiP computes large survival fractions<br>of ice particles (fsurv = 0.91), see Fig. 5. An enhanced vertical diffusivity has a minor impact on N. The slow decrease in<br>the first hours is caused by the turbulent decay process simulated according to Eq. (49). Later, the loss by aggregation<br>dominates by far.<br>The optical depth values of the two models differ most<br>strongly. The CoCiP optical depth comes closer to the 2d<br>model result for enhanced vertical diffusivity. Later, the optical depth increases in CoCiP because the contrail particles<br>start to sediment. Hence, the contrail gets thicker, and collects more humidity from the ambient air, giving larger ice<br>mass, with larger particles and, hence, larger optical thickness values. In contrast, the 2d model predicts a decrease<br>in optical depth after 3 h age. One possible reason for this<br>difference is the limited depth of the supersaturated layer in<br>this example with ice sedimenting out of the layer in the 2d<br>model, while CoCiP follows the plume in Lagrangian manner without loss of ice mass. A second reason may result<br>from the assumed ice saturation in the contrail. At late times,<br>the few remaining ice particle may no longer be effective in<br>keeping the contrail at ice saturation, causing less ice water<br>content.<br>Figure 15 shows further results to explain the contrail dynamics. The left lower panel of this figure shows the small<br>initial downward displacement of the contrail center simulated for the wake vortex phase. Later, this displacement<br>grows and exceeds 1 km because of sedimentation. The near<br>constant number N of particles share in the growing amount<br>of ice mass from entrained humidity in supersaturated air.<br>Hence, the particles grow in size (see top left panel). Eventually, the particles become large and start sedimenting quickly.<br>In reality the largest particles would sediment first while the<br>smaller ones stay longer at the initial altitude (Jensen et al.,<br>1998a). This separation of particles cannot be simulated with<br>the plume-bulk model. Instead, CoCiP simulates this process by letting the center of gravity of the contrail sink with<br>time (see left lower panel), similar to what has been deduced<br>from observations (Atlas et al., 2006). At the same time, the<br>contrail depth increases by enhanced vertical diffusivity, see<br>Eq. (35). At contrail ages of 8.7 h and 6.7 h, for the high<br>and low emission cases, respectively, the particle sizes exceed 100 µm in radius, the fall speed exceeds 0.7 m s−1<br>(see<br>lower panel of Fig. 8). Hence, the contrail falls quickly and<br>precipitates at lower altitudes. We note that a reduction of the<br>initial particle number and an increase of vertical diffusivity<br>have similar effects on sedimentation (see mean radius and<br>vertical displacement in the left panels of Fig. 15).<br>In a rough approximation, the model simulates the effects<br>of fallstreaks which have been observed to form below contrails at high ambient humidity (Schumann, 1994; Heymsfield et al., 1998; Atlas et al., 2006). This process effectively<br>limits the contrail life-cycle at high ambient humidity. Contrails would live longer for lower ambient humidity because<br>of less sedimentation and aggregation. For this reason, the<br>contrail climate impact does not increase linearly with humidity. The example results show also the importance of soot<br>emissions. Reduced soot emissions reduce the number of ice<br>particles but increase their sizes. As a consequence, both the<br>www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/543/2012/ Geosci.

(2009) and for the<br>CONCERT campaign (Voigt et al., 2010). (We do not expect<br>good agreement for CoCiP for the youngest contrails.) For<br>plume ages larger 150 s, some of the data have been used before to test LES models (Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a;<br>Naiman et al., 2011). Also, CoCiP has been tested before<br>by comparison to data for six contrails measured during one<br>measurement flight in CONCERT; here we compare in more<br>detail to the data for a CRJ2 aircraft from that campaign<br>(Voigt et al., 2010).<br>The observational data are compiled in Table 4. We replace the reported ice particle concentration nm by nice =<br>IWC/((π/6)ρiced<br>3<br>mean), i.e. the value consistent with the reported ice water content IWC and volume mean diameter<br>dmean; both values, partly with large differences, are listed<br>in Table 4. The measured concentrations are uncertain due to<br>variable lower cut-off size of ice particles in the data analysis (Febvre et al., 2009). Some aircraft types and humidity<br>values were unknown and had to be estimated.<br>Measurements of relative humidity at low ambient temperatures are prone to large uncertainties. The ambient humidity<br>may be estimated for the measured ice water content assuming that the ice water content stems from condensing ambient<br>supersaturation and from the emitted water.

This highlights the importance of the water emitted by the aircraft engines in addition to water from ambient supersaturation for young contrails. The measured IWC for the youngest plume cannot be<br>explained this way. The computation for the small age would<br>imply negative ambient humidity. The maximum analyzed<br>humidity values are in a reasonable range, above saturation<br>but below homogeneous nucleation thresholds (Koop et al.,<br>2000), as expected for persistent contrails.<br>We apply CoCiP for static atmospheres (without subsidence and other changes with time), mostly under ice supersaturated conditions in clear air. During these conditions and<br>ages, the ice loss terms of CoCiP, Eq. (48), though included<br>in these computations, are small. Table 5 lists the model parameters as used for these simulations.<br>The results are most sensitive to ambient humidity RHi<br>and to dispersion (as a function of ambient shear S), as to be<br>expected. CoCiP is run with RHi= 0.9 for those cases where<br>the table indicates smaller RHii values. Unfortunately, also<br>ambient shear, as listed in Table 5, and stratification had to<br>be estimated. In most cases, shear was not reported. Even<br>when the velocity profile was measured (Febvre et al., 2009),<br>where shear was quite large, the effective shear value is difficult to derive because of large variability. Hence, we apply<br>the model with a set of S-values, 0, 0.001 s−1<br>and 0.002 s−1<br>.<br>The results are shown in Fig. 17. The CoCiP results for<br>low and high shear values embrace most of the observed data<br>points. The IWC results for this input are close to the observed values as they should because of adjusted humidity<br>values. The agreement is not perfect, because the dilution<br>in CoCiP depends on the unknown shear, and differs from<br>the empirical dilution function, as expected. With this input,<br>CoCiP reproduces the data as observed in most cases, see<br>Fig. 17. For example, the model comes closest to the observations of Febvre et al. (2009) (ages 150 s and 900 s) for the<br>largest S-value. An exception is case A of Schroder et al. ¨<br>(2000), with smallest (5 s) plume age, for which the measured IWC is far less than computed.

However, the agreement with observations deteriorates when DV<br>gets increased compared to the reference case. Hence, the<br>diffusivity parameterization should stay unchanged.<br>It appears that the bulk microphysics model used in CoCiP<br>is sufficient to explain the contrail properties consistent with<br>the observations. The agreement between results and observations is at least as good for CoCiP as it is for LES models<br>(Unterstrasser and Gierens, 2010a; Naiman et al., 2011). To<br>some extent this implies that the set of measurements are not<br>complete (e.g. for shear) or accurate enough (e.g. for humidity) to provide rigorous constrains. However, the comparison<br>shows that the model gives a fair representation of the fraction of particles surviving the early wake vortex. There is no<br>hint for important ice nucleation in volatile particles in these<br>cases.<br>3.5 Further discussion<br>The results presented provide support for the usefulness of<br>the model. However, because of the large number of meteorological and traffic input parameters and the simplifying<br>assumptions used in the model, further parameter and validation studies are to be performed. For example, the model<br>results depend critically on the quality of the NWP humidity<br>input data. These have been shown to be reasonable (Tompkins et al., 2007; Lamquin et al., 2012). It also depends on the<br>parameter RHic used in the troposphere in the NWP model,<br>and on further parameters, such as the type of interpolation<br>(in absolute or relative humidity, Appendix A2). These parameters should be varied and tested by direct comparisons<br>of measured and computed contrail results. The single Gaussian plume model may need improvements for the wake vortex phase. Two plumes instead of one may be used to simulate the primary and secondary vortex parts (Gerz and Ehret,<br>1996; Lewellen and Lewellen, 1996) separately. This would<br>allow simulating deeper sinking of the primary wake vortex part without overestimate of dilution. A deeper sinking<br>would reduce the survival factor of ice particles in the wake<br>phase. The model assumes ice saturation and equilibrium inside the contrail, which may cause significant errors for low<br>ice particle concentrations. The model in the present form<br>does not account for radiative heating which may be essential for thick long-lived contrails. The contrails are simulated in this paper without feedback among each other or<br>with the background meteorology. Narrow contrails fill only<br>a small fraction of the grid volume of a NWP model, so<br>that the change of grid cell mean humidity by few contrails<br>is small. Larger changes may occur for overlapping contrails and for many contrails in one grid cell (Burkhardt and<br>Karcher ¨ , 2011). Coupling of the model with the NWP model<br>is an option to test the importance of this feedback. The bulk<br>model does not account for the dependency of the equilibrium vapor pressure on the ice surface tension (Kelvin effect)<br>which is important for very small ice particles (Pruppacher<br>and Klett, 1997). A recent study suggests particle losses due<br>to larger crystals scavenging water vapor from smaller ones<br>because of the Kelvin effect (Lewellen, 2012). More research<br>is required to improve understanding and modeling of the microphysics controlling ice crystal number losses (Sect. 2.12).<br>Theses losses are critical for the simulated contrail lifetime<br>and climate impact. As explained, only few data exist to test<br>the lifetimes of contrails. This is also true for cirrus and<br>ice supersaturated regions in general. CoCiP may serve as<br>a model framework for testing alternative ice bulk models in<br>relationship to contrail observations.<br>4 Conclusions<br>The contrail physics model implemented in the “Contrail Cirrus Prediction Tool” (CoCiP) has been described in detail.<br>The model has been applied successfully for a global case<br>and for individual contrails in comparison with other model<br>results and in-situ measurements.<br>The Lagrangian Gaussian contrail model treats the lifecycle of contrails with bulk contrail ice physics, containing<br>several simplifying assumptions (see Sect. 3.5).

The numerical scheme is unconditionally stable and<br>guarantees positive definite solutions. The simulation of an<br>individual contrail along a flight track with hundreds of waypoints with maximum lifetime of order a day, requires far<br>less than a second computing time on a laptop. This makes<br>contrail simulations for a large fleet of aircraft feasible.<br>The model accounts for the influence of aircraft properties and ambient meteorology. This includes standard contrail formation thresholds, advection, turbulent mixing, and<br>ice mass formation from emitted and ambient humidity, with<br>ice crystal number depending on the number of soot particles emitted. The model includes simple approximations for<br>ice particle survival in the adiabatically sinking wake vortices, and particle losses in aged contrails. These model parts<br>may need to be further improved when comparing to further<br>observations. Moreover, we note the strong sensitivity of the<br>model results to turbulent diffusivities. This calls for further<br>refinement of the parameters for this purpose, e.g. kinetic energy and dissipation rates from NWP input data.<br>CoCiP provides a generalization of an often used simple dilution function derived previously from measurements<br>(Schumann et al., 1998). The dilution of passive tracers from<br>aircraft engines in the wake vortex and dispersion phases depends weakly on aircraft properties and rather strongly on<br>shear and stratification in the ambient atmosphere.<br>The model reproduces measured contrail properties for<br>given aircraft type in terms of ice water content, crystal<br>number concentration, and mean crystal diameters, in contrails of about 100 s–2000 s age. Comparable measurements<br>in isolated single contrails at larger ages are missing.<br>The CoCiP model constrains the ambient relative humidity at the time of contrail formation, which is difficult to measure. It is also used to estimate the ambient wind shear controlling contrail dispersion. The comparison supports the assumption that the number of ice particles in the contrail at<br>several minutes plume age is mainly determined by the number of soot particles emitted by the aircraft engines. Turbulence and cloud physics are equally important for explaining<br>observed contrail dynamics.<br>Particle loss processes, in particular sedimentation in<br>warm ice supersaturated air masses, control the contrail lifetime. Such contrails end with fallstreaks. Contrails persist<br>shorter for smaller soot particle emissions. Aged contrails<br>contribute most to climate change because of largest product<br>of optical depth and width.

Both variants introduce up to 7.2 % errors (either in RHi or in q) for 50 hPa pressure intervals, see Fig. A1.<br>CoCiP has been coded in both variants, and the differences<br>have been found to be important because of strong sensitivity<br>to relative humidity in the SAC and to absolute humidity in<br>the ice water content and optical depth.

Figure A4 shows the change in relative humidity versus time after emission for selected values<br>of ambient temperature T (200 K and 240 K) and pressure<br>p (100 hPa and 400 hPa). The water vapor emission contributes considerably to relative humidity at low temperatures<br>(where ambient air contains little water vapor).

On input, flight<br>way points are given consecutively with small longitude increments (we require increment less than 300◦<br>, which should<br>be sufficient even close to the Poles). However, flights passing the date line, with some longitude values exceeding 180◦<br>in magnitude, require special attention.<br>For contrail analysis, all segment coordinates are left unchanged from the input. This allows for straightforward computation of segment length and direction values (the latter is needed for computing the horizontal velocity component Vn normal to the segment). Only for interpolation in<br>NWP data, we shift longitudes by ±360◦<br>into the inner range<br>−180◦ < x ≤ 180◦<br>.<br>However, for plots and related analysis, one needs to map<br>the flight paths and contrail segment coordinates to the inner range. This is done (in module TESTD) by inserting two<br>extra points into a segment whenever passing the date line,<br>one with x = 180◦<br>, the other with x = −180◦<br>, where the<br>sequence depends on the flight direction. All other contrail<br>properties (except segment length) are interpolated linearly<br>between the original endpoints to the new end points. Special<br>Geosci.
