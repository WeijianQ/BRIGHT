*Why do cyanide and arsenic smell like almonds and garlic, respectively?
Why do humans smell arsenic as garlic or cyanide as almonds? Do both smells activate the same receptor? Is there any reason why our brain interprets these smells the same?*

> As a tasteless and odourless white powder, arsenic is minimally soluble in cold water but dissolves easily in hot fluids such as tea or cocoa. The symptoms of arsenic poisoning include watery diarrhoea, causing dehydration and hypovolaemic shock. If it results in hepatic and renal impairment, there may be a garlic smell to the victimâ€™s breath.

> Uses[edit]<br>Benzaldehyde is commonly employed to confer almond flavor to foods and scented products, including e-cigarette liquids. It is sometimes used in cosmetics products.<br>In industrial settings, benzaldehyde is used chiefly as a precursor to other organic compounds, ranging from pharmaceuticals to plastic additives. The aniline dye malachite green is prepared from benzaldehyde and dimethylaniline.  Benzaldehyde is also a precursor to certain acridine dyes. Via aldol condensations, benzaldehyde is converted into derivatives of cinnamaldehyde and styrene. The synthesis of mandelic acid starts with the addition of hydrocyanic acid to benzaldehyde:<br><br>The resulting cyanohydrin is hydrolysed to mandelic acid. (The scheme above depicts only one of the two formed enantiomers).<br>Niche uses[edit]<br>Benzaldehyde is used as a bee repellent.  A small amount of benzaldehyde solution is placed on a fume board near the honeycombs. The bees then move away from the honey combs to avoid the fumes. The beekeeper can then remove the honey frames from the bee hive with less risk to both bees and beekeeper.<br>Benzaldehyde reacts with nitroethane in the presence of a catalyst to produce phenyl-2-nitropropene, a precursor to amphetamine and other chemicals.

> Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) is an organic compound consisting of a benzene ring with a formyl substituent. It is among the simplest aromatic aldehydes and one of the most industrially useful.<br>It is a colorless liquid with a characteristic almond-like odor, and is commonly used in cherry-flavored sodas. A component of bitter almond oil, benzaldehyde  can be extracted from a number of other natural sources. Synthetic benzaldehyde is the flavoring agent in imitation almond extract, which is used to flavor cakes and other baked goods.
