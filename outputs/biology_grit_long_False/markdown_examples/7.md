Synovial fluid cavitation has some evidence to support it. When a spinal manipulation is performed, the applied force separates the articular surfaces of a fully encapsulated synovial joint, which in turn creates a reduction in pressure within the joint cavity. In this low-pressure environment, some of

However, this is not supported by medical research.<br>The cracking mechanism and the resulting sound is caused by dissolved gas (nitrogen gas) cavitation bubbles suddenly collapsing inside the joints. This happens when the joint cavity is stretched beyond its normal size. The pressure inside the joint cavity drops and the dissolved gas suddenly comes out of solution and takes gaseous form which makes a distinct popping noise.  To be able to crack the same knuckle again requires waiting about 20 minutes before the bubbles dissolve back into the synovial fluid and will be able to form again.<br>It is possible for voluntary joint cracking by an individual to be considered as part of the obsessive–compulsive disorders spectrum.

> Causes[edit]<br>The sound can be created when two rough surfaces in an organism's body come into contact—for example, in osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis when the cartilage around joints erodes and the surfaces in the joint grind against one another, or when the two fractured surfaces of the broken bones rub together. Crepitus is a common sign of bone fracture.<br>Crepitus can easily be created and observed by exerting a small amount of force on a joint, thus 'cracking it'. This is caused by bubbles of nitrogen forming in the synovial fluid bursting. Almost every joint in the body can be 'cracked' in this way, but the joints which require the least amount of force to produce this effect include the hallux (big toes), the knuckles and the neck joints. This phenomenon is caused when the movement of the joint lowers the pressure of its synovial fluid, causing the bubbles to form and burst. A refractory period of about 20 minutes exists where the joint cannot be stimulated to produce crepitus after being cracked until the nitrogen gas dissolves back into the synovial fluid.<br>In soft tissues, crepitus can be produced when gas is introduced into an area where it is normally not present.<br>The term can also be used when describing the sounds produced by lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease; these are also referred to as "rales". Crepitus is often loud enough to be heard by the human ear, although a stethoscope may be needed to detect instances caused by respiratory diseases.<br>In times of poor surgical practice, post-surgical complications involved anaerobic infection by Clostridium perfringens strains, which can cause gas gangrene in tissues, also giving rise to crepitus.<br>Subcutaneous crepitus (or surgical emphysema) is a crackling sound resulting from subcutaneous emphysema, or air trapped in the subcutaneous tissues.
