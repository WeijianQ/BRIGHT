*Why can't humans drink sea water?
It would seem to be a huge evolutionary advantage for an animal to be able to drink sea water rather than have to rely on fresh water, and it's provably not impossible due to the existence of sea mammals that must filter the sea water somehow.
Could someone explain to me any likely reasons that this is the case?*
